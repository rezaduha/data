The increasing adoption of innovative home products in India demonstrates that it is only time before each urban house owner can confidently seek to live in a smart home.\n\n**What is a Smart Home?**\n\nA smart home uses an intelligent device to manage or digitize daily tasks. These homes are usually built around the central hub that enables interaction between several devices in the house.Biosensors, intelligent thermometers, wall adapters, gadgets, moisture sensors, door and window sensor systems, motion detectors, and many other embedded systems are elements of these devices. A smart home, like a smartphone, can automate many more of your housework.\n\n## What is Smart Home Security Systems and How Does it Work?\n\nA home security system comprises a variety of electronic components that connect with a centralized location and work to protect a home from attackers, natural disasters and any accidents.\n\nThe primary goal of a home security system is to protect your property and the people who live in it. A breaking, violent assault, fire, storm, or another natural disaster can all cause damage. Most security systems can keep an eye out for all of these. These systems employ a network of sensors that share information via radio transmissions or cables to a centralized location, which is then conveyed to the outside world via a data connection or, in some cases, a landline. The gateway is generally a mobile device mounted on your ceiling or a small box positioned on a counter or in a cabinet.\n\nThe sensors are strategically placed throughout your homes, such as at entry points like doors and the first doors and in halls and elevated areas. They identify when a window or door is opened and closed and when someone moves around and in your house. When the system is activated, it sends a notification to the hub when a sensor is triggered. If you have professional surveillance, the center will sound an alarm, send a report, and can alert a monitoring system.\n\n**Some [Important Features of Smart Home Security System](http://www.mnttechnologies.com/home-automation/)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhether you rent or own your home, you can reap the benefits of having a security system. That protects your property, smart home security has several advantages over more traditional home security systems, including greater flexibility, convenience, and peace of mind.', 'smart-home-security-systems', '2022-04-27 06:31:51', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 4),

Emerging technologies are increasing the performance of conventional modes of transportation, while new inventions are positioned to completely revolutionize the way we progress. The transportation industry, like every other industry, is adopting technological trends to improve productivity. However, it is important to note that these technological trends will not only improve productivity but will also [transform the transportation industry](https://www.aeologic.com/blog/nine-ways-technology-will-change-transportation-in-2022/) forever!\r\n\r\nAll over the world designers and scientists are working on new types of transport that will allow us to grow faster and further than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we\'ll point out some of the most promising and amazing future transport concepts that are being worked out right now.\r\n\r\n## Trends Technologies in Transportation\r\n\r\n**The following technologies have propelled themselves to the forefront of the most recent transportation revolution.**\r\n\r\n### 1. The Hyperloop\r\n\r\n![The hyperloop project image](the_hyperloop_Rjffji3289_710bd6369f.jpg)\r\n\r\nA pet project of Elon Musk\'s companies Tesla and SpaceX, is perhaps the most revolutionary transportation technology currently in development. The best way to describe Hyperloop is as a type of vacuum train, a long tube in which passengers carrying capsules travel at incredible speeds in a vacuum. That means it moves without friction and has the potential to reach speeds of more than 750 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n### 2. Median AMB Vehicles\r\n\r\n![Median amb median ambulance image](median_amb_median_ambulance_sndfjabfh4_71e3f26a78.jpg)\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Median AMB vehicles has revolutionized the way road accidents are being managed today. A road traffic accident that happens on a highway is likely to be more serious than a road traffic accident that happens on a regular road because of the speed involved. Unfortunately, the response time that it takes for emergency service vehicles to reach the site of a highway accident isn\'t always great because of congestion and also because of the distance between hospitals and medical facilities. That means the people who need emergency assistance the most will often wait for the longest.\r\n\r\n### 3. Twin Metro Train\r\n\r\n![Modern architecture train image](architecture_modern_train_gd1e6bbde9_1280_784745d340.jpg)\r\n\r\nIdeas like the toyline jar twin metro train might change the way that public transport is thought about and make people more likely to use it. This is a futuristic double-decker train that runs on super-powerful magnets. Many major cities would like more of their population to use public transportation as opposed to driving to and from work because public transportation is usually more environmentally friendly than driving a car and creates less congestion and also solves the parking issues. Donald Shoup, a distinguished professor in the field of urban planning and mobility rightly says that \"Intelligent transportation technology is key to better parking management\".\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is right to state that the transportation industry is adopting technologies and going through major changes.

A **remote patient monitoring program** is what it\'s called. This healthcare facility allows patients to communicate directly with doctors without having to physically visit the clinic. Through virtual consultations and e-prescriptions, it assists physicians in maintaining a high level of care.\r\n\r\n## What is Remote Patient Monitoring Program?\r\n\r\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a type of healthcare delivery in which patients\' health is monitored using technology outside of a regular clinical environment. RPM is a delivery mechanism within the greater telemedicine sector that uses specific technologies to electronically communicate information between patients and clinicians.\r\n\r\nRPM services, unlike other telehealth delivery techniques, do not necessitate engaging audio-video and virtual visits, nor do they require patients to live in remote areas. They merely require physiologic data collection and interpretation equipment. RPM services are reimbursed by Medicare in the same way that in-person clinical services are, with no additional requirements for utilization or originating site of care. RPM systems also have the potential to save money by preventing more serious and costly health effects from developing.\r\n\r\n## The market Trend in Remote Patient Monitoring\r\n\r\nAccording to Research and Markets, the global RPM systems market will be worth over $1.7 billion by 2027, up about 128 percent from the $745.7 million potential it presently offers.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent poll performed by SISGAIN in Virginia, 65 percent of patients choose to utilize [remote patient monitoring program](https://sisgain.com/remote-patient-monitoring-software-development-in-virginia) devices since the outbreak of the pandemic, which has doubled in the last two years.\r\n\r\nDoctors and medical practitioners may now provide patients with effective and cost-effective medical services thanks to video conferencing and remote patient monitoring technologies. They can assess, inspect, and analyze patient data that is electronically transferred to their databases. The data is transferred following the HIPPA agreement, which ensures that the information shared is private and safe.\r\n\r\nThe remote patient monitoring program empowers doctors to take care of patients suffering from chronic illnesses and allows them to monitor high-risk patients at home. It is important for the medical professionals who are offering remote patient monitoring services to get connections that are secure to access data and view patients’ medical condition records.\r\n\r\n[Remote Patient Monitoring](https://sisgain.com/) has reduced the hospitals’ problems of not having enough staff. In the traditional setting, it is found in a survey that for each patient there is a need for one doctor, three-four nurses, and at least 1 whole room if the patient is suffering from a serious illness. But in virtual consultations, patients no more need to visit hospitals and they can rest in their homes which in turn leads to early recovery and healing of wounds.\r\n\r\nRPM instruments are expected to be used by 70.6 million patients, or 26.2 percent of the population, by 2025, according to a recent survey.\r\n\r\nHospital readmission penalties are already being reduced by providers who use RPM-enabled home health monitoring systems and other telehealth delivery techniques by providing patients with tablets and RPM equipment.\r\n\r\n## Remote Patient Monitoring Software Development at SISGAIN\r\n\r\n![Patient monitoring software development image](patient_monitoring_software_development_Bv_S7q4y_F_Qt_4aead7425b.jpg)\r\n\r\nSISGAIN is one of the **top remote patient monitoring companies in Virginia**.

That’s why I’ve put together this list of questions you should think about asking your chatbot company before you decide to work together.\n\nA chatbot is a great way to interact with your customers. But how do you get started creating a chatbot yourself?\n\nA lot of information is available online, but quite frankly it\'s scattered around different websites and forums. In this article, I want to help you cut out the noise.\n\nHere, I will answer the eight (most important) questions you should ask yourself before you start building your chatbot.\n\n**1. What purposes should your chatbot fulfill?**\n\nTechnology work best in your favor if it is used in the right way and knowing the purpose before going first-hand with it makes a better choice.\n\nA one-size-fits-all solution can become a nightmare if you don’t really know what you want it to do for your organization or business.\n\nA chatbot as a [ai-services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) can be a good way to reduce the number of incoming calls to a customer service department. But this isn’t always the case. You need to have a specific objective for why you want to use a chatbot.\n\nFor example, if you know the type of queries that can be raised then a simple command bot help that responds in a structural flow with the limited possible questions and answers.\n\nAnd if you want, your chatbot to resolve a bit high level of complexity then you may need a conversational bot with artificial intelligence.\n\nDepending upon the factor between reducing contact rate number or you want to focus more on customer satisfaction objectives the choices may differ.\n\nHence, you should design it from the start with this in mind. Otherwise, you’re going to end up with an expensive system that doesn’t really help you achieve your objectives.\n\n**2. Knowing about your target audience**\n\nA chatbot is good for one thing, interacting with humans. Good robots, smart algorithms, and a natural language processing engine are not enough: what you really need is to ensure that the human on the other side feels like the interaction was worth their time.\n\nConsumers have acquired a taste for using chatbots. But when they don’t work as expected, they quickly lose interest. That’s why it’s crucial to define who your chatbot’s target audience is right from the start.\n\nBefore you start putting the wheels in motion on an AI system, it’s important to take stock of your audience. Doing so will help you figure out who is going to be using your chatbot and how they expect it to work.\n\nFor example, your major audience prefers Spanish and your chatbot interacts with them in English. This may create a barrier instead of a solution and can frustrate customers on the other side.\n\nYou need to clarify the **chatbot development services company** about the type of audience so that they can create a multi-lingual chatbot for you instead of a general type.\n\n**3. Which type of chatbot do you want**\n\nYou want a chatbot for your business or organization. There are several factors that may affect the choice you made like the budget and complexity of queries.\n\nYou\'re pretty sure simple or complex are the two main options. But figuring out which one is right for you can be tricky if you don’t know about them.\n\nBasically, there are three types of chatbots. The first one, Simple or scripted chatbots that are designed to respond to specific questions. They follow conversational scripts whereas AI chatbots use artificial intelligence to understand the flow of conversation and respond accordingly. And last but not least Voice bot is also a type of them.\n\nAs with all things in life, it\'s best to bear in mind the saying – never jump into something new without knowing what you\'re actually getting yourself into. So understanding the complexity of customer questions and choosing wisely the right bot is the only suggestion.\n\n**4. What questions should the chatbot be able to answer?**\n\nIf you are looking to build a successful bot to satisfy the greatest number of users, it’s important that you list the questions it should be able to answer. Prioritize your most frequent customer service requests.\n\n**5. Where do you want to deploy your chatbot?**\n\nIt’s a big question, so let’s break down the sites and channels you can use: Facebook Messenger, Slack, Twitter DM, webchat on your site, or your mobile app.\n\nYou’ll also want to choose one or more channels depending on your ideal user base, keeping in mind that today’s customers want seamless experiences across channels.\n\nUse this guide to help you make these important decisions — it can save you time and headaches later on.\n \n **6. What is your budget?**\n \n It may be hard to think about spending more right now, but keep in mind that many vendors offer low-cost chat solutions that usually perform below expectations. Basic chatbots often frustrate customers and put more pressure on your support teams.\n\nMost of the low-cost chatbot solutions out there are pretty basic. You get what you pay for, so plan on spending a bit more for an intelligent bot that will actually understand and help your customers rather than frustrate them by not being able to solve their problems.\n\n**7. Do you have the capabilities to manage your chatbot?**\n\nThe chatbot needs attention to make sure it’s going well. And for that either you have to hire a member to ensure it\'s integrated, optimize well enough and look into the fault which can create miscommunication, or you can choose an external solution?\n\n If you have staff on board who are trained in chatbot technologies and know the ins and outs of your customer service strategy, an in-house implementation may be right for you.\n\nBut if you’re unsure about how to utilize this technology, or don’t have enough team members to handle it, then consider teaming up with an experienced vendor.\n\nFor example, **Botgo chatbot development services company** creates and helps you to manage the chatbot **ai-service** to serve you better results.\n\n**8. What is the vendor’s track record with similar companies?**\n\nOkay! this question may not seem important, but it helps you to gain valuable insight into the **chatbot service provider**. It helps to build reliability with a vendor who has a proven record of previous work in the same industry.\n', '8-most-important-questions-to-ask-before-implementing-of-a-chatbot', '2022-04-30 04:02:48', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 2),

This assists them in making major business decisions.\n- When BI solutions are used, it is easier to understand customer preferences.\n- Using these solutions, businesses can determine outperformance and output nuances. They can determine where sales are low and which departments are underperforming, among other things.\n\nUsing a powerful BI tool like Microsoft Power BI, achieving these goals is simple. However, in order to get the most out of the tool, you will need to hire experienced [power bi consulting services](https://www.motifworks.com/powerbi-consulting-development-services/).\n\n## Why should you use Power BI as your primary BI solution?\n\nAlthough there are other BI solutions available, Power BI remains a favourite among many enterprises around the world. Its supremacy in this arena is due to a number of factors.\n\n**Ease of Use**: Without a doubt, Power BI outperforms competitor BI tools in terms of ease of use. The programme is really sophisticated, but the user interface is straightforward. It can also be highly customised. Even if you\'ve never used a BI tool before, you should be able to get started without much help. The majority of users adjust to it without difficulty. It offers a user interface that is straightforward and intuitive to use. You won\'t require any prior programming knowledge. The complex capabilities, on the other hand, will necessitate the assistance of a seasoned Microsoft Power BI developer.\n\n**Excellent Integration**: Most firms that install a BI solution have numerous other applications in use, therefore the BI tool must be interoperable with those apps and cloud services. Power BI comes out on top in this category. It\'s compatible with a variety of Microsoft apps and cloud services. It also works with a variety of third-party software and database systems. This aids in the import of data from multiple sources as well. When using Power BI, businesses don\'t have to worry about application support.\n\n**Extensive Data Visualisation Capabilities**: Simply analysing massive amounts of data is insufficient. A BI tool should include enough data visualisation features to allow the analysed data to be used to create visually appealing reports. Power BI comes with a plethora of data visualisation elements and features. It includes a plethora of maps, graphs, and charts, as well as the ability to use images and other media content. This enables users to make the best use of data while also conveying the message to the intended recipients.\n\n**Easy Report Creation and Sharing**: After analysing a massive amount of data from multiple sources, your company must generate useful reports that can be shared with the entire workforce. Report creation is a breeze with Power BI. Using its built-in features, you can create visually appealing reports in a matter of minutes. The generated reports can be shared with other users in a variety of formats. You can even share these reports with people who don\'t use Power BI. Reports, for example, can be exported in PPT format.\n\n**The Flexibility of Use**: If you think BI tools like Power BI are solely used by technological giants and MNCs, you\'re wrong! The truth is that Power BI is appropriate for use by businesses of all sizes and types. If you have a new or growing business, go with the free version, which has a lot of features. There are license-based cloud versions aimed at customers with deep pockets. It can also be downloaded as a mobile app. As a result, the range of applications is enormous. Power bi professional has corporate customers who swear by it.\n\n**Powerful Solution**: Many of the operations performed by Power BI can also be completed using spreadsheet programmes. However, Power BI outperforms the competition when it comes to sheer processing power and the efficient use of computational resources. Large data files can be processed more quickly. When compressing or decompressing data volume, there will be no noticeable delay. It seamlessly connects to supported data sources, and automated data synchronisation collects data at pre-determined intervals.\n\nWhen you utilise a BI tool that interacts with a large volume of data, protecting the data\'s security is critical. The good news is that Power BI comes with built-in data security measures. For example, AAD is built-in for user authentication.\n\nThere are numerous other reasons why Power BI is still the most popular tool for BI and data visualisation. Its regular updates, resources, and simple yet effective query (natural language query engine) feature all work in its favour.', 'five-significant-advantages-of-microsoft-power-bi-for-data-scientists', '2022-04-30 04:07:27', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 4),

This tool\'s main goal is to give the best BI utilities, Business Intelligence reports, and analytics features to its users. This software includes a cloud-based service feature in the desktop-based interface. It\'s a one-stop-shop for business intelligence, with features including data discovery, data transformation, and graphically engaging dashboards. Power BI focuses on data modeling and report development rather than visualization. From the unified dashboard, you can easily generate reports with a few clicks.\n\nOther data sources can also be connected with this tool by using the appropriate connections and drivers. You can also select a scalable dashboard for optimal visualization.\n\nBefore comparing Power BI to other BI tools, here are the top features to be aware of.\n\n- Dashboard is Simple to Use\n- Add a Data Source\n- Visualization that is personalized\n- The language of nature Report Generation for Q&A \n- Report Generation for Q&A\n\nMany of the other BI tools available on the market include:\n\n- Tableau\n- SSRS\n\n## Power BI Vs Tableau\n\n**Data Access**: Power BI connects directly to Salesforce and Google Analytics, but not to the Hadoop database. Tableau has the ability to connect directly to Hadoop. To be honest, most industries do not require the Hadoop feature because it deals with massive amounts of data. Most businesses are small to medium-sized and do not require such extensive data processing.\n\n**Visualization**: Microsoft\'s tool includes 3500 data points for analyzing your dataset and making decisions using predictive analytics consulting. even if you have no programming skills, you can still do it. Natural language queries are possible. Tableau is well-known for its visual data presentation, but it requires some prior coding experience to use. Tableau has about 24 baseline visualizations.\n\nPower BI is only available in one deployment mode, SaaS BI (Software as a Service). On the other side of the fence, Tableau is available in two models: cloud and client machine installation. Depending on how much data you have, you can choose between cloud and installation formats. When there is a large amount of data, it is advised to use a cloud model.\n\n## Power BI Vs SSRS\n\nPower BI is free, whereas SSRS requires a SQL Server license to run. To use PBIRS, however, you must first purchase a Power BI Premium license.\n\nPower BI is available as a SaaS (software as a service) in the cloud (software as a service). SSRS is a component that is installed on a server.\n\nPower BI has sophisticated graphical capabilities. SSRS is a more traditional type of software that requires manual intervention to create reports and analyze data.\n\nIn the case of Power BI, you can use cloud data, but SSRS can only handle on-premise data.\n\nThe successor to SSRS is PBIRS, or Power BI Report Server. It supports both PBIX and analytical XLSX reports. SSRS does not support either of these.\n\nPBI has been upgraded to include Cortana integration for Natural Language Processing. This feature is not supported by SSRS.\n\nPower BI has a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality for creating reports. Unlike other BI tools such as Tableau, you can use it without any programming knowledge.\n\nPower BI enables the use of unstructured data, modern rendering techniques, and seamless integration across multiple platforms. With built-in features, multiple data cubes can be integrated.\n\nAs you can see, even the free version of Power BI contains a lot of sophisticated capabilities that other BI tools don\'t have. \n\nIt can also be used without any coding knowledge. \n\nPower BI is inexpensive and accessible, even in enterprise editions, making it accessible to small and medium-sized organizations.\n\nMotifworks is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner with a proven track record in [Power BI Consulting](https://www.motifworks.com/powerbi-consulting-development-services/).

It is most important to achieve quality software at speed despite the increase in the complexity of systems, environments, and data.\n\nHere, we are sharing the top trends in  software testing services. that have emerged in a few years. With Agile and DevOps, test automation, AI emergence, we are able to see some major transforming trends for 2022.\n\n**What Are The Top Software Testing Trends In 2022?**\n\n## 1. Agile and DevOps\n\nToday, several IT firms have adopted Agile considering the dynamically changing shift in requirements. DevOps is a response to the demand for speed.\n\nDevOps includes strict rules, processes, and tools that can assist them in integrating the development and operation activities. This process reduces the time of the processes for development to operations. To be precise, organizations are actually looking for this methodology and other ways to shorten the software development life cycle.\n\nforThis adoption of Agile and DevOps is helping the teams to deliver quality software at reduced time. For the last five years, several businesses have invested in their interests and continue to intensify in the future.\n\n## 2. Test Automation\n\nTo implement DevOps successfully, a software team cannot escape the test automation. It is an integral part of DevOps processes. Businesses are preferring automation testing over manual testing. They are considering keeping most of the regression testing at automation.\n\nToday, there are several automation tools such as Selenium, Katalon, and TestComplete to make automation much more efficient.\n\nWe are also seeing the rise in the need for test automation with the API and Services. It is outpacing the functionalities of the end-users on user interfaces.\n\n## 3. Artificial Intelligence for Testing\n\nAlthough the application of AI and Machine learning is in its early stage. The AI/ML approaches to address the issues in software testing are not new. The recent growth of AI/ML is posing several opportunities for testing.\n\nThe algorithms based on AI/ML generate better test cases, test scripts, test data, and reports. They also render smart analytics and visualization to support the teams to detect faults, understand test coverage, areas of high risk, etc.\n\n## 4. Test Environments and Data\n\nThe rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) simply means more involvement of operating systems from several environments. This poses a challenge for the testing teams to ensure the right scope of test coverage. Indeed, the lack of test environments and data is a top challenge when applying to tests in agile projects.\n', 'what-are-the-top-software-testing-trends-in-2022', '2022-04-30 04:20:03', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 3),

Here are 7 best practices to improve the mobile app user experience!', 'Mobile app development starts and finishes with the user. The contrast between a fruitful mobile app and one that falls flat in the market is a quality UX (user experience app design).\n\nWithout an intensive comprehension of your target users\' in-app personal conduct standards or mental underpinnings, you will not have the option to build a mobile product to fulfill a focal objective or surpass customer expectations.\n\nMobile app user experience includes everything affecting a user\'s discernment and interaction with a product. Developing a mobile app against user data works with the design thinking measure, which makes useful solutions to address genuine user trouble spots.\n\nThis article traces seven distinct strategies to implement the lifecycle of design and development to accomplish optimal user experience for mobile applications.\n\n## What are the Suggestions to Improve the Mobile App UX?\n\nThese days, there are a huge number of apps accessible in the market!\n\nIn 2023, 80% of individuals on earth will purchase a mobile device, taking a gander at the figures that mobile overwhelmed desktop purchases.\n\nThe undeniable justification for these figures is the expansion in mobile utilization among individuals. Individuals have begun examining the User Experience (UX) of any mobile application, alongside survey products, looking at prices, reviewing, purchasing, and so forth\n\nThus, assuming you need your users to invest more energy on your mobile application, then, at that point you need to make it more user-friendly and interesting. Consequently, without UX, we may never patch up app usability.\n\nInvestigate the focuses of the below points by the user interface design company readily enhancing the digital experience with mobile apps:\n\n**Reduce Search Effort**\n\nHelp your users discover what they need quickly to fulfill their necessities and drive conversion rates. There are various pursuit strategies you can integrate into your apps, for example, scanner tag examining and catchphrase search.\n\nProviding users with an inquiry alternative and channels to guide them straightforwardly to what exactly they\'re searching for will fundamentally expand conversion rates.\n\nThe motivation behind this technique is to help users find precisely the thing they\'re searching for so it\'s significant that the hunt reconciliation doesn\'t channel down to zero results.\n\n**Use Native Component In Your Mobile Application**\n\nThe motivation behind why you ought to pick native is that individuals will realize how to utilize it. For instance, when an application reveals to you how to navigate starting with one screen then onto the next, it tends to be truly muddled for users to sort it out.\n\nConsequently, if users definitely know the native UI element, it will be simple for them to follow the means, as they will intuitively comprehend the application. Besides, you can add animation, transitions or automation, since they \'look great\' in native mobile apps.\n\n**Personalize The UX**\n\nPersonalization gives a more remarkable and pertinent experience to the user. Sooner rather than later, personalize the UX by leveraging user data to show applicable content and material in the app.\n\nMaking it a stride further, remembering the user\'s name for the screen and informing is a simple and viable approach to personalize.\n\nMake certain to just show hyper-significant content to every individual user for the best results. Implementing too many message pop-ups or pushing unimportant content will no doubt aggravate the user.\n\n**Keep Your App Design Simple**\n\nThe users of your application have certain objectives as a top priority and on the off chance that they discover an obstruction in their manner, they might get frustrated or invest more energy than expected, losing their direction meanwhile.\n\nAlso, the mobile application\'s features and functionalities will lead them away from their objective. Subsequently, you ought to have a moderate design approach to make a straightforward and exceptionally usable mobile application.\n\n**Improve The Search Feature Ιn Your App Design**\n\nUsers go to your app proposing to accomplish their objective or find and purchase your products and additional benefits. On the off chance that your app has not sufficient or helpless navigation and valuable connections are elusive, then, at that point, there are chances that users ricochet back to your competitor\'s app.\n\nYou can provide an in-app web search tool to make the pursuit simple and quick. The simple navigation design progressed search, and information architecture will all improve the usability of your app by and large.\n\n**Animate Your Transitions**\n\nAnimated transitions are another powerful method to make a consistent flow while moving to start with one page then onto the next. The user might likewise want to see an animated transition in-app at whatever point they complete an activity.\n\nTry not to have animations without earlier user activity. The animation ought to be utilized such that the user can see how to finish an activity. It is OK to have a couple of animations in your app, however, don\'t over-burden it with animations.\n\n**Test the App to Improve It!**\n\nThe best method to test mobile usability is to perform distant user testing. This will permit you to get input from distant users after they have effectively utilized your product.\n\nAfter this, the app development group will continue on with quality affirmation and dispose of any \'bugs\' they might meet. Henceforth, user testing is an incredible method to see through your users\' eyes and feel as they do while they are really utilizing your application.\n\nOn the off chance that you implement these focuses, you will get the best mobile app UX design, a really engaging and helpful one for your users.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou ought to make an iOS and Android app user experience that will make your users need to attempt your app and visit it once more. With the end goal for you to achieve this, you should begin implementing best practices for your mobile application.\n\nYou should consider user objectives while designing the mobile app. You should test your mobile application as much of the time as time permits you to.', '7-effective-ways-to-improve-user-experience-on-mobile-app', '2022-04-30 04:25:16', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 2);

You learn so quickly that you have to do a little more to stay ahead of the competition. For this reason, you should choose and decide what costs you will invest in because every time is important. By definition, you have a smaller budget than large companies and you are forced to work in a very economical building. This often means that small businesses give up seemingly inexpensive software options and opt for handmade processes because they seem cheaper on paper. Hiring is especially important in this regard.\n\nFrom a self-employment process to automation using [applicant tracking systems](https://www.recruitbpm.com/applicant-tracking-system) can have many benefits. Features included in the many tracking systems of applicants can help to increase the recruitment process to keep working hours and the selected applicants are more qualified and more likely to stay in position.\n\n## The best process for reviewing elections\n\nThe process of reviewing candidates is complex, requiring a systematic approach to the process of reviewing applicants. Often, we see that hiring managers and departmental committees to work with them can be orderly, ineffective, and subject to their baptismal candidates. Relying too much on the gut to feel instead of concrete behavior or other test data means that interviewers are more likely to miss out.\n\n[Applicant tracking systems benefit](https://www.recruitbpm.com/blog/recruitbpm-chrome-extension-its-benefits/) from this process by creating a systematic approach that would be submissive by establishing and recording a candidate rating system that everyone can use. This removes any misconceptions or misinterpretations that may occur during the hiring process.\n\n## Provide a Better Intervention Experience\n\nHaving an application tracking system not only saves HR departments time but also saves applicants\' time. The simple and accessible application allows the candidates to apply for the job quickly and easily, resulting in a better experience. And, if it is quick and easy, more options can complete the process, expanding the talent you can choose from.\n\nIn addition, automated email that provides regular and timely communication with your baptismal candidates can greatly enhance student engagement and experience. Those with good experience are more likely to accept your job, re-apply in the future, or transfer others to your company.\n\nThe reason some job seekers do not like to use ATS may be due to a lack of understanding of how it benefits them. See why application tracking systems are not an enemy of the applicant.\n\n## Easily share tasks\n\nAutomatically upload your activities and share them on various job exchanges, social media, individual channels, etc. with a few clicks using ATS. You no longer need to set up an account manually for each channel and worry about keeping each track separately. Also, you will be able to see the success of ads and channels through analytics collected from ATS.\n\n## Save time and money\n\nBasically, applicants\' tracking systems are designed to help businesses save time and money. By using automated processes, they reduce the amount of paperwork required by HR staff, which helps save time and reduce administrative costs. Application tracking systems can also save on advertising costs by automatically posting job vacancy ads on sites and finding candidates who are already \'on file\' to contact.\n\n## Improved Interaction\n\nThe remote operation does not have to mean lower productivity. Another benefit of an online tracking system while working remotely is that the entire team can continue the recruitment process together even when they are not in the office. Building on a cloud-based system, an online applicant tracking system brings the whole team together on one platform, so everyone looks at and uses the same information throughout the business. Even if employers do not live close to each other in the office, they can still work together to fulfill tasks and build customer relationships.\n\nFor example, when nominating a candidate through the recruitment process, employers may wish to pass on important information about the candidate to the party they will see. Instead of sending an email, send a message to your group, or speak to them directly as you would if you were working together in the office, add a note to the baptismal record, which will be visible to everyone who looks at that record. This allows the group to cooperate in locating the candidate for baptism even if he or she is working remotely.\n\n**Which ATS would be best for your organization?**\n\nNot all ATS is the same as many highlight various features and strengths. Determining the right plan for your organization begins by compiling a list of your major challenges and identifying the best solution for each issue. Challenges can include interview planning, supply chain management, job posting management, finding a candidate, etc.\n\nNo matter what your specific needs are, understanding them will help you choose the best plan for your organization.', 'requirements-for-the-main-applicant-tracking-system', '2022-04-30 04:29:13', '2022-05-07 22:15:14', 4, 2),

But what exactly do these buzzwords imply? Let\'s learn more about these terms.', 'Data Science, Machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are all part of the same area and are related, they each have their own applications and meanings. There may be some overlaps in these sectors from time to time, but each of these three components has its own set of applications.\n\nTo have a deeper understanding of each of these concepts, let us dissect each of them one by one. \n\n## Data Science Overview\n\nData science is a vast branch of research that focuses on data structures and procedures with the goal of sustaining and deriving meaning from data sets. To make meaning of random data clusters, data scientists utilize an assortment of tools, applications, principles, and algorithms. It is becoming increasingly challenging to monitor and preserve data since practically all types of companies generate exponential volumes of data from around the world. To keep up with the ever-growing data collection, data science deals with data modeling and data warehousing. Data science applications extract information that is used to influence business processes and achieve organizational goals. There are many leading data science institutes all over the world where you can learn deeply about data science and its practical implementation.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence Overview\n\nAI has generally been associated only with innovative robots and a machine-dominated society, a fairly overused tech term that is regularly employed in our popular culture. However, Artificial Intelligence, entail, is far more applications. \n\nIn simplest terms, artificial intelligence tries to enable machines to reason in the same way that humans do. Because the major goal of AI operations is to instruct machines through experience, it\'s critical to provide the relevant information and allow for self-correction. Natural language processing and deep learning are used by AI professionals to assist robots in identifying patterns and inferences.\n\n## Machine Learning Overview\n\n Machine learning is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic the way humans learn, with the goal of steadily improving accuracy. Algorithms are trained to produce classifications or forecasts using statistical approaches in data mining operations, revealing crucial insights. These insights then drive decision-making in applications and enterprises with the goal of impacting critical growth KPIs.\n\nMachine learning requires monitoring and analyzing data in order to discover patterns and create a reasoning framework surrounding them.\n\n## What is the difference between Data Science and Artificial Intelligence?\n\nAlthough they branch off of the same domain, there is a difference between data science and Artificial Intelligence in areas concerning application and operations. Artificial Intelligence is a vast field that has mostly remained untapped. Data Science is a branch that emphasizes processing datasets and visualizations, as well as using AI to provide predictions.\n\nThe difference between Data Science and Artificial Intelligence can be briefly discussed in the following points:\n\n- Processing, assessing, visualization, and forecasting are all part of the Data Science process. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is the use of a predictive model to predict future events.\n- Data Science employs a variety of statistical tools, whereas AI employs computer algorithms.\n- The tools employed in Data Science are far more extensive than those that are used in AI. This is due to the fact that Data Science entails a number of stages for evaluating data and extracting insights from it.\n- Data science drives the goal of detecting hidden patterns in data. While AI entails drives on the goal of giving autonomy to the data model. \n- For developing models statistical insights are utilized in Data science. Artificial Intelligence, on the other contrary, is used to create models that mimic human intellect and comprehension. \n- Data science in comparison with Artificial intelligence does not have the requirement of scientific processing of high or advanced level.\n\n## What about the difference between Data Science and Machine Learning?\n\nThese two buzzwords are frequently used interchangeably, however, they are not synonymous. The basic differences between Data Science and Machine Learning can be made in the following points:\n\n- Data Science is the study of methods and systems for extracting information from structured as well as semi-structured data. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that enables computers to learn without even being explicitly programmed.\n- Data Science requires the complete universe of analytics. Machine Learning on the other hand requires a blend of ML and data science\n- Many data science functions, such as data collection, data filtering, data manipulation, and so on. However, ML entails three types of Learning - Reinforcement, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning\n- DS is used to extract information from data. While machine learning is used to make predictions and classify the results.\n- DS is a comprehensive term that refers to the process of developing and deploying a model for a specific situation. ML is employed in the data modeling stage of the data science process as a whole.\n\nRegardless of the fact that the three domains -DS, ML, and AI are all interrelated, they have distinct characteristics and applications.

With online learning platforms, it has become very easy to impart quality education to students.

That\'s one of the major benefits of A-levels as well - With this course, students can only take the subjects in which they are interested, and it is beneficial for them as well.\n\nDue to the wide range of subjects, it can get hard for students to study and understand these subjects.

Presently, we should jump further into the critical differences between a Culinary Arts Certificate versus a Culinary Arts Degree.', 'Choosing to pursue a career in the culinary arts is one of the numerous critical decisions you will make for your future. Another major decision is whether you need to pursue a Culinary Certificate/diploma or a Culinary Degree. The answer to that question weighs vigorously on the kind of career you are pursuing. The two options give advantages, but on the off chance that you might want to get into the executives in the foodservice industry, a more significant level of training is by and large required. Presently, we should jump further into the critical differences between a Culinary Arts Certificate versus a Culinary Arts Degree.\n\n## Length of Curriculum\n\nFirst, how long do you need to acquire the required insight and schooling? In case you are looking to just become familiar with the basics in a shorter timeframe, a Culinary Arts Certificate might be the ideal alternative for you. As a rule, most Culinary Arts Certificates are finished within 8-12 months or around 1-2 full semesters. This can rely upon the school and in case it is a conventional course versus a more specific specialty, similar to pastry chef.\n\nThen again, a Culinary Associate Program requires seriously schooling. The normal Culinary/Food Management Degree is around 15-24 months (contingent upon the institution). The Culinary Degree requires additional time because it includes a more top to bottom degree of instruction, remembering courses for hospitality executives, showcasing, and similar business classes.\n\n## Subject Area\n\nIn each culinary program, you will acquire similar skills, but the Culinary Arts Degree will additionally dive into the significance of the board skills, and different opportunities in the field. Nonetheless, the two programs will give you a solid establishment in cooking and culinary skills.\n\nThe degree will teach you administration skills, industry trends, business ethics and principles, and even food costs. As a student studying to be a leader chef, you will be needed to concoct a distinctive menu, purchase the food, and oversee the kitchen. Accordingly, a degree would be more qualified for a student aspiring to be a head/leader chef or restaurant administrator.\n\n## Acquired Value\n\nThe worth of each program depends on how you are hoping to manage your career. In case you are simply interested in cooking in a restaurant or essentially getting some conventional preparation, the certificate might be the better alternative. The Culinary Arts Certificate will show you the basics of what you need, while you acquire insight into a kitchen. Nonetheless, in case you are expecting to work in an administration position, by and large, a Culinary Degree will be required. Regardless of whether you are unsure of which way is ideal for you, acquiring that extra schooling and degree could give you the benefit for a potential occupation position.\n\nGenerally speaking, which kind of schooling you choose to pursue depends on your needs and career goals. Some positions require a degree, while others don\'t. The additional experience and instruction can just help you pushing ahead, but a degree is not necessary for all positions.\n\n## Additional points of diploma\n\nDiploma programs offer students an opportunity to increase their insight, skills, and abilities, and do it in a short measure of time. With a diploma, graduates can discover invigorating career opportunities in a wide range of fields.\n\nJust what is a diploma in culinary arts? This diploma can be procured in around one to two years, contingent upon how long a student is ready to give to their schooling. Figuring out how to make incredible food is just one step in a culinary arts program. Students also figure out how to master kitchen techniques, the development of cuisine, the effect of culture on food, and to display leadership and trust in the kitchen and then some.\n\nDiploma programs can be exceptionally gainful for graduates. Individuals acquire certifiable career insight, they work on their necessary culinary skills, and they can increase their subject information, which makes graduates with a diploma in culinary arts entirely desirable for companies.\n\nThe cost of procuring a diploma in culinary arts can change contingent upon how long it takes to acquire, as well as each school\'s specific educational cost rates and fees. Interested students should anticipate reaching any prospective schools to get relevant monetary data. The monetary guide might be also accessible to assist with offsetting the cost of procuring a diploma.\n\nIndividuals with a diploma in culinary arts can work in any gastronomic industry, as a restaurant administrator, a professional or chief chef, as a caterer or a catering chief, the head cook of a bistro or bistro, or as a chief for a food distributor. Graduates may also pursue a more pioneering course and open their restaurant.\n', 'which-is-better-diploma-or-degree-culinary-program', '2022-04-30 13:09:17', '2022-05-07 22:15:15', 2, 6),

English is the best communication language in major digital activities. Novelists, IT professionals, students, entrepreneurs, doctors, and working professionals use English in their workplace and academic studies. English has become quite common in social life as well.', 'English is a language that is full of synonyms, homophones homonyms that seem to make it especially difficult to learn. Enhancing your English language skills is something that you will undoubtedly develop in your career in your lifetime. There are many proven advantages in enhancing your knowledge of vocabulary, but most people have not spent much time learning new vocabulary since from their childhood. Here are some effective ways to enhance your knowledge of vocabulary to sound smarter.\n\n## Read Voraciously\n\nThe most effective way to get new vocabulary is to keep on reading it. While reading, you can see words used in context, which is the best way than simply memorizing word lists. Reading the new word that surrounds the context information is the best chance to guess its meaning just by understanding the overall text. There are plenty of new words in the English learning app from where you can update your vocabulary knowledge by learning it with the sentence.\n\nReading the vocabulary with the sentence is one of the natural ways of learning the new vocabulary. You should not be afraid of coming across new words because you cannot succeed in your aim with a lack of confidence.\n\n## Read High Literature\n\nYou can learn many new words by reading as many books as you have the time and inclination for. Try to read high literature books to get more professional in knowing new vocabulary and speaking. Reading nonfiction and technical book will not only teach you new ways to speak but also new ways to think. Instead of sticking to a single subject, read various subjects like philosophy, science and religion. In the spoken English app, you can learn about high-level words that make you appear still more professional in the way you speak.\n\n## Set a goal\n\nSet a goal for yourself in building your vocabulary. A good and healthy commitment is very important when you plan to do something. For instance, you can commit to learn three new words a week and work them into your speech and writing, or as per your requirement and convenience, you can fix the number of words you need per day or per week. The important thing is you have to implement those words in your speech or writing to get more familiar with those words.\n\n## Lookup any words you don’t recognize\n\nYou should not skip the unfamiliar words when you come across them. Instead of skipping, try to find the possible meaning in the context of the sentence by looking it up in the dictionary or other sources. If you want, you can also make a note of new words for better remembrance in future.\n\nMaintaining a personal lexicon can help you to review those words later when required. If you feel that going back and refreshing your memory on recent words can be difficult, then keep the words in your own list to make it more efficient. Even though you are not referring to your lexicon, writing new words will improve your ability to commit them to your permanent memory.\n\n## Use visuals\n\nThe undying fact is that 50% of the brain’s resources are used upon vision alone, which means people spend half of their brainpower on noticing motion, shapes and colours around us. Human eyes are not only power-hungry, but they are also sponges for information. To speed up the learning process, try using image-based flashcards or adding pictures to your vocabulary definitions. By using visual aids, you can remember the new words even more easily than other methods.\n\n## Get some sleep\n\nMost people know that sleep plays a big role in learning new things that is when you learn something new and have a nap before being tested on it, you will be more likely to remember it than if you were tested after an interval that didn\'t include any sleep. Short term memories include things you have just learned, so, during sleep, your short term memories just consolidate into your long term memory.\n\nThis process can’t take place when you don’t go to sleep, so you are more likely to lose the information you just learned. It improves the ability to learn a lot of new things easily and remember for a long time.\n\n## Play and have fun\n\nEngaging in group activities and playing games will be very useful in any kind of learning and particularly effective for language-related learning. You can play word games together with your family or friends. You can have more interesting learning sessions in online spoken English training, which will enhance your interest in learning new things.\n\nThere are numerous options for word games on the internet, so you can use them if you don’t have time or don’t want to engage in group activities. If you are almost good at speaking, you can play them when you are bored, or you can incorporate them into your daily routine if you are looking to improve your language.\n\n## Follow a process\n\nYou should make the process as habitual, automatic, and tightly integrated into your daily workflow as possible to make vocabulary improvement as a permanent habit in your everyday life. If you are not following the process, then you might skip the process when your days get too busy. You can stick the word in a predefined place you use to process them much more efficiently.\n\nYou will stay on top of your vocabulary improvement process by knowing exactly how and how often to process your inbox. You can also make your convenient way for incorporating the newly learned words in your daily routine to familiarise yourself with the new words.\n\n### Wrapping it up\n\nFollowing the above-mentioned points can highly help you in enhancing your knowledge of vocabulary to sound smarter. Other than this, there are many ways to improve your knowledge of English vocabulary. The only thing is you have to know the exact meaning of the word you learning because, without the proper understanding, it might be difficult for you to remember those words.\n\n', 'eight-ways-to-enhance-your-knowledge-of-vocabulary-to-sound-smarter', '2022-04-30 13:16:44', '2022-05-07 22:15:16', 2, 6),

That’s right. The same Millennials whose motto could be “Why buy a car when you can Uber?”\r\n\r\n“This debunks the myth that Millennials aren’t as financially focused as other generations,” says Edward Jones investment strategist Nela Richardson. And the survey isn’t some outlier. It’s supported by other research.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve Survey on Consumer Finances found that while Millennials are deep in debt, more than 42 percent have retirement accounts, the highest share for those under 35 years of age since 2001.\r\n\r\nPart of what’s driving Millennials’ emphasis on saving could stem from lingering memories of the Great Recession. “Back in the late 2000’s, the oldest cohort of millennials entered the worst job market since the Great Depression of the 1930’s,” says Richardson.\r\n\r\n“For younger millennials, watching their parents and other family members go through that experience may have also made them more aware of the risks of a market downturn or some other unexpected event, such as losing a home or a job, and so they’re more conservative when it comes to spending and saving in their adult lives,” says Richardson.\r\n\r\nOne potential alarm bell uncovered by Edward Jones’ sampling of more than 2,000 adults nationally age 18 and over: While 92 percent were honest enough with themselves to recognize there was room for improvement in their financial health, the very thought of saving money sufficed to make more than a third feel either “anxious” or “overwhelmed.”\r\n\r\n**If that sounds familiar, here are three steps to consider:**\r\n\r\n ## Identify your money-related emotions.\r\n\r\n![Man holding us dollar image](man_holding_us_dollar_929288_3085588b37.jpg)\r\n\r\nPeople often have emotional responses to money. Getting a big bonus at work can make you feel euphoric; agonizing over what to do with it can be paralyzing even as the logical part of your brain (invest at least most of it) fights it out with the emotional part (splurge it all!). What’s key is knowing that letting your feelings dictate your spending, saving and investing choices can lead to poor decisions.\r\n\r\n## Develop a financial strategy.\r\n\r\n![Financial strategy image](financial_plannig_S_Bxd_M9z_M_dcd4e07710.jpg)\r\n\r\nKeeping your cool starts with identifying your main goals – a down payment on a new home, college for your children, a comfortable retirement – and then sticking to a sound, long-term path for attaining them.\r\n\r\n## Get an “accountability partner.”\r\n\r\n![Crop colleagues shaking hands in office image](crop_colleagues_shaking_hands_in_office_567348_9fda2cfff5.jpg)\r\n\r\nMeaning, someone with whom you’re comfortable sharing your finances. It could be a family member. Or a professional financial advisor, who has the perspective, experience and skills necessary to help you make the moves appropriate for your situation.\r\n\r\n“Whether you are strapped with student debt, saving to buy a home or trying to build an emergency fund, there are trade-offs that must be made in balancing these short-term goals and our long-term financial future, such as investing for retirement,” Richardson says. “Without a sound financial strategy, most people tend to be reactive rather than proactive and feel that their money is controlling them.”', 'three-ways-millennials-can-start-saving-more-money', '2022-04-30 13:33:06', '2022-05-07 22:15:16', 3, 6),

Dressing well is just the starting point. The following tips will help you to appear truly sophisticated all season long.\n\n## 1. Stay two steps ahead\n\nWhether it’s an upcoming client meeting or a weekend fete, sophistication is a mere keystroke away.  Plan your day ahead by researching the who, what, when and where for whatever event is on tomorrow’s calendar. Want to really swing for the fences? Go to your appointment or event five minutes early.\n\n## 2. Bring a gift\n\nWhile not required, it’s always appreciated. Nothing says class like someone who arrives with a bottle of wine, a seasonal floral arrangement or even just some homemade baked goods. A small, subtle gift for a host or hostess can go a long way in establishing that sophisticated image you desire.\n\n## 3. Put the pen to work\n\nDust off that box of thank-you cards you stashed in your bottom desk drawer, and get to writing. Emails are nice but are used everyday for everything. A thank-you card is more personal and serves one purpose: to make a person feel appreciated. Take note of the important people in your life who deserve a special shout-out.

On the day of the procedure - do not rinse, do not spit, and no drinking through a straw.\n2. Bite down on a folded up piece of gauze for 30 minutes.\n3. Switch out to a new piece of gauze every 30 minutes until the bleeding stops.\n4. If it keeps bleeding you can wet a black tea bag and bite down onto it.\n5. Starting the day afterwards you can start using a salt water rinse every time after a meal.\n\nJust to reiterate, start rinsing with salt water every time after a meal but starting not on the day of but the next day after the tooth extraction.\n\n- Put about a teaspoon of salt into a cup.\n- Add 8 oz of water.\n- Rinse your mouth very vigorously to dislodge and food debris in the socket.\n- You may repeat more than once to ensure that all food particles have been expunged.\n\nIt is important to remember that you should only do this the next day and not on the day of because any type of rinsing will cause the bleeding to continue.\n\n**Why, does it bleed more when you rinse?**\n\nIt bleeds when you rinse because the blood clot is trying to form but any type of pressure in the mouth will dislodge the blood clot and that is usually when it keeps bleeding. If you think about it, the spitting and drinking through a straw both create a lot of pressure in the mouth. That is what you want to avoid, pressure in the mouth. The bleeding should stop the day after, which is why we recommend to do the salt water rinsing then.\n\n**What happens if you don’t do the salt water rinses?**\n\nIf you don’t do this type of mouth rinse, food will get stuck in the extraction sockets and that will delay healing. It will take your body a longer period of time to close up the hole in the gums because food keeps interfering with the healing process.\n\nAside from delayed healing, any food that is stuck in there will start to ferment. What this means is that it will start to smell. What do you think happens when you leave food out on the table for the next 7 days? It will start to rot and smell correct? The same thing happens if food is stuck in the hole and you leave it there for days. You will start to notice a very foul odor.\n\nMaybe then you will be encouraged to do the salt water rinses.\n\nThere is also one last additional effect from the salt water rinse and that is the salt has a natural anti inflammatory effect. It will help keep the swelling down around the area. If you can keep the swelling under control for the gums, it will have a chance to heal faster.

The local Berber people have traditionally used this oil for culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic purposes. In its purest form, the suitability of Argan oil for the face, hair, and nails applications is well-proven. That is why it is increasingly popular as an essential ingredient in shampoos, soaps, conditioners, lip glosses, and many other cosmetic products.\n\nNot only is Argan oil safe for direct skin application, but it also contains a variety of therapeutic elements and vitamins that work together to improve skin health. You are not likely to experience any instances of skin irritation after applying this oil. You might find it beneficial instead for reducing acne, preventing oily skin, providing sunburn protection, and healing various severe skin conditions.\n\n## Benefits of Argan oil for face application\n\nThe golden Argan oil contains a high concentration of vitamin E, fatty acids, and antioxidants. These restoring nutrients nourish the skin and act as excellent natural moisturizers. By using Argan oil for the face, you can reap these benefits:\n\n### 1. It can treat acne\n\nHormonal acne is often the consequence of an excess of sebum produced as a result of hormonal changes. The sebum clogs the skin pores and causes blackheads and acne. Argan oil contains anti-sebum properties that may help control the quantity of sebum produced by the skin properly. As it is also non-comedogenic, there will be no issue about it adding to the problem and clogging your skin pores.\n\nIt may instead aid in preventing further acne breakouts.

Do not worry if you have a bad credit history. Buying a car is now possible for everyone, especially if you can manage a decent down payment amount.', 'There are several ways to buy a car, especially with a down payment. If your credit score is low and you have no time to rebuild it, you can put money down to purchase your dream car. It does not matter if you buy a used car or a new one, down payment can improve your bad credit auto loan approval chances. It is a smart choice to make a down payment.\n\n## How does Down Payment benefit Bad Credit Car Buyers?\n\nAs a car buyer, there are many benefits to making an upfront payment to the dealer.\n\n- **Get Lower Monthly Payments**: When you make a down payment, the size of your loan will become smaller, and thus, your monthly payments will reduce as well.\n\n- **Enjoy A Shorter Loan Term**: A hefty down payment can lower your loan term and reduce your overall monthly costs of owning a vehicle.\n\n- **Get Reduced Interest Amount**: With a down payment of at least 10% of the total cost of the car, you will be able to pay off your loan early and enjoy a reduced interest amount.\n\n- **Avoid Negative Equity**: If the buyer wants to sell the car, it would be easier for him as the market value will be higher than the loan amount.\n\nIf you’re willing to put a down payment, the bad credit auto financing process will become easier and faster. You will be able to nullify the effects of your bad credit score and enjoy an affordable deal. So, it is smarter to seek a down payment for your next car.\n\n## Why do Lenders look forward to Down Payment?\n\nIf you have money for a down payment, you will borrow less from the lender thus, save more! But, how does that benefit the lender? Why do lenders look forward to a higher down payment amount?\n\nLenders want to protect themselves if you are unable to pay them back. Because of your bad credit history, they may be wary of your financial situation. They don\'t want you to owe more than the value of the vehicle, and a down payment amount will close this gap between the sale price of the car and its actual market value.\n\nAdditionally, the down payment displays your current financial condition to the lender. Credit scores and past financial statements provide a history to the lender. But, if they want to understand your current financial situation, the down payment amount will inform them whether you are capable of making an upfront payment or not. It will assure them of regular monthly payments in the future. It will also save them from undergoing the cumbersome repossession process.\n\n## Can you afford to make a Down Payment?\n\nBefore you search for different car models, find how much you can afford as the down payment. There are many factors to determine the best down payment amount for your situation, such as your credit score, the car\'s sale price, and how big a monthly payment you want. Consider everything when deciding how much money to put down on your new vehicle.\n\nIf you look at the benefits of the down payment, you may want to borrow money from a friend or a family member, take a second job or sell your belongings. However, avoid seeking personal loans from lenders because they are expensive. And, if you are unable to pay them in the future, the loans will affect your credit score severely.\n\nIf you are unable to make a down payment, search for no down payment auto loans. Several subprime lenders offer bad credit no money down auto financing options to help car buyers. To get approval, you must submit an online auto loan application form with all details about your personal finance. Provide pay stubs for the last six months. If you are self-employed, offer two years of tax returns to the lenders. It will help them in making a decision.\n\nDown payment is essential but not mandatory for buying a car.

While this is\ngreat news as it means you have plenty to choose from, it can also make the choices so much more overwhelming.', 'Where do you even start your search when you’re looking for mens surfing t shirts or surf board shorts?\n\n**These tips will help to make your search easier. **\n\n## Choose the right material\n\nWhile canvas and cotton shorts look good and fall really well, these are not suitable for wearing in the water. These fabrics will absorb water and hang heavily on you making it almost impossible to surf. The right material for mens surf board shorts should be stretchy and capable of wicking away water instead of absorbing water. Also look for a fabric that breathes a bit so that it keeps you cool and comfortable instead of hot and uncomfortable. You can even find mens surfing t shirts and shorts that are environmentally friendly and made from recycled fabric.\n\n## Check out the seams too\n\nThis is something that most people don’t pay much attention to but they can in fact make a huge difference to comfort as well as durability. Surfing is a very active sport so you need to wear clothing that will withstand all the rigors you put it through. Suring shorts and t shirts generally have a very strong seam that is capable of handling anything you put it through. They are also tough enough to handle the damage done by the sun and sea. Good quality surfwear will always have seams that meet these parameters while also being flattened down so that they don’t chafe or irritate your skin.\n\n## Make sure you get the right size\n\nFit matters when you’re out there riding the waves. Shorts that are too big will form ugly gathers at the waist and are more likely to fall off with the weight after absorbing water. Shorts that are too tight on the other hand will make it impossible to bend and turn and will restrict your movements on the board while also being incredibly uncomfortable. Make sure to measure your wait and hips before buying a pair of mens surf board shorts online. If you’re buying mens surfing t shirts online, you’ll need to know your collar size as well as the length.\n\n**Is it possible to get the right fit when you buy mens surf board shorts online?**\n\nAbsolutely!

Once you know what you’re looking for you can filter down your options to find the best choices for you. You can further filter down the prices so that you find one that fits your budget too.\n\nOne piece of advice that most surfing experts offer is to shop the big brands when you’re looking for mens surf board shorts.

The origin of the game can be traced to the nineteenth century. It is adopted as a sport in many schools of developed nations. Two baskets, two teams, and one basketball is the requirement to put this game into motion. The game has steadily increased in fame and has several million fans worldwide. Each team consists of five players whose aim is to score more goals than their competitor does. The game involves dribbling, jumping, making shots, and getting the ball into the net. Players who are the center of attention are LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis, to mention only a few. The basketball hoops(basket) is usually 10 foot high, although it can be lower for children. This is where an appreciable height comes to play.

Tennis may be played between two players, or two teams consisting of two players each. The main rule of the game is that the ball must land within bound range. If the ball lands outside the range, the player loses points. When a player passes a ball, it is called serving. There are four different types of serve- slice, kick, flat and underhand serve. The serve can be your fuel for victory, or it will ridicule your hopes. When serving, you have complete control of the ball. The tennis ball is relatively smaller than the football or basketball. The ball is very bouncy, making the game easier. The Venus sisters are tennis sensations that people love.

The target in a baseball is to score runs. This is possible if the team can touch the four bases. Each team consists of nine players. Baseball is a game that requires speed, sturdiness, and intelligence on the field. Baseball is popular because it helps individuals develop their physical attributes, patience, and strategy. We can trace the root of the game to the United Kingdom. You need to dress properly in the batting helmet, baseball cap, baseball cleats, and bat to play this game.\n\n## CRICKET\n\nCricket is an old game of 11 players. The captain determines if the team will bat or bowl first. The most important feature of this game is speed. The players have to be swift and agile to get the ball to score more runs than their opponents do. Cricket can be wrapped up in a day, or it may last for five days. The players are in three categories- batsmen, bowler, and fielder. The batsman is responsible for scoring runs. The bowler is in charge of bowling, and the fielders prevent the other team’s batsmen from scoring. The batsmen are the Centre of attraction in a cricket game.

You may have seen Billabong mens knit wovens shirts and noticed the iconic double wave logo', 'Founded in 1973, Billabong has since been one of the leading companies in manufacturing and selling surfing wear. With the company now on its 48th year of operations, let us take a brief look into the history of Australia’s most iconic surf brand.\n\n## Before Billabong\n\nGordon Merchant, one of the founders, liked to travel a lot in Australia during the late 60s and 70s, totally embracing the surfing lifestyle. The goals of his travels were to find the best surfing spot to settle in. He would pack maps, tents, sleeping bags, and surfboards unto a Kombi van to aid him in his travels.\n\n## Homemade Boardshorts\n\nThis surfing brand giant started with humble beginnings. Thanks to his experience when travelling in the years prior, Gordon learned to develop breakthrough innovations in surfing gear. Billabong mens shorts in its earliest form is the starter of the business. The founders, Gordon and Rena Merchant designed and made boardshorts at their home and sold them to the local surf shops. The durability of their boardshorts were the its biggest strength, a quality soon noticed by surfers in the area.\n\n## Sponsoring Events and Growth\n\nIn order to boost the new company’s exposure and business, Billabong started hosting surfing events. This proved to be a very smart move which caused the company to grow faster. By the 80s, Billabong mens shorts were already available all throughout Australia. With the whole of Australia included in their operations, Billabong started putting their sights towards exporting products to other surf-loving countries – New Zealand, Japan, USA, and South Africa.\n\n## Fast Acquisitions and Collapse\n\nBillabong grew fast. With this fast growth, the company started to make acquisitions of other sport-related brands. Gordon followed his customer’s wants and needs and ventured into different kinds of board sports. Billabong reached a peak where is managed around 10 sport-related brands including Von Zipper, Kustom, Xcel, and RVCA.\n\nThe growth and acquisition continued to grow, but that growth was halted in 2012. Billabong experienced serious financial difficulties. Some say that Billabong got too much on their hands due to their acquisitions, losing clear sight of their core business strategy. Sales dropped and profits declined.\n\n## Comeback\n\nBillabong was able to make deals with the US that enabled the company to get back on its feet.

It\'s no secret that UFC president Dana White is the most prominent and well-known person in MMA history. Over the last two decades, the former Boston Harbor Hotel bellman and boxercise teacher has built the nascent UFC into a worldwide empire, and he shows no signs of slowing down.', 'According to gossipop.com, White\'s projected net worth is over $500 million ahead of UFC 264, which features a trilogy fight between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor. But does it stop there? The simple answer is no, since White\'s hobbies span from expensive automobiles to excessive rounds of blackjack at Las Vegas casinos.\n\n**How much money does Dana White earn in a year?**\n\nWhite\'s career as UFC president has modest beginnings. After barely finishing high school as a student at Bishop Gorman, White worked for a pavement business, as a bouncer at a neighborhood club, and ultimately as a bellman. Before his life was permanently altered, he began training local fighters in Vegas how to fight.\n\nAround 1997, White went with NSAC member and old high school buddy Lorenzo Fertitta and expressed his desire to get into boxing. According to the narrative, White and Fertitta started investigating the world of combat sports through a new lens, MMA.\n\nZuffa LLC eventually turned the UFC into the most lucrative sports brand in the world, selling the promotion to Endeavor for $4.025 billion in 2016. White, to say the least, walked away with a tidy amount of money.\n\nWhen you do the arithmetic ($500 million/12 months), White now earns about $416,666 per year.\n\n**Will Dana White ever resign as UFC president?**\n\nEventually, sure.

We know how important it is to feel prepared for class, and we hope that our notes help you feel confident and ready.', 'The hearsay rule is contained in section 59 of the evidence act 1995. It states, “Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation.” This is called the ‘Hearsay Rule’. In simple words, a person cannot give evidence about\n\nFew facts are needed to know about the Hearsay Rule in Australia\n\n**1. Evidence Relevant for Non-hearsay purpose (s60)**\n\nThe clause means that when [evidence law notes](https://www.lawskool.com.au/undergraduate/evidence-law) are for non-hearsay purposes, the hearsay evidence rule does not apply to that evidence. For instance, a witness might have made a statement before producing evidence in court. And if there is an imbalance between the information of the witness and what the witness produces in court, then the report should be examined to prove the actuality of any facts contained in it. \n\n**2. Maker Unavailable (s65)**\n\nIf a person who stated a statement is not available in criminal proceedings, evidence law notes that were ordinarily not permitted under the hearsay evidence rule may have the opportunity to get admissible in certain conditions.\n\n**3. Maker Available (s66)**\n\nThe hearsay evidence rule might be relaxed if the person who started the statement is obtainable in criminal proceedings. If another person witnessed that person stating the information and the events are fresh in their memory, then that evidence law notes would be admissible.\n\n**4. Tags, Labels and Writing (s70)**\n\nThe hearsay evidence law does not apply to tags, attached labels or placed writings that outline the contents of objects or documents.\n\n**5. Electronic Communication (s71)**\n\nThe hearsay evidence rule does not apply to the identity of the sender, the date and the time of the communication being held, and the identity of the person/body to whom the message was sent.\n\n**6. Relationship and Age (s73)**\n\nThe hearsay evidence rule also does not apply to the evidence mentioning whether a person is or was at any time, married or unmarried, to a person’s age, their family history or family relationship. But in a criminal matter, the exception only is permissible if the defendant provides reasonable notice to other parties or if the evidence would refute other admitted evidence.\n\n**7. The reputation of Public and General Rights (s74)**\n\nIn criminal cases, the hearsay evidence rule about public or general rights is only permissible by the prosecutor only to contradict the assertations by the defence.\n\n**8. Evidence in Interlocutory Proceedings (s75)**\n\nIf a party can produce evidence as to the source of a hearsay statement, then this evidence would be permissible in interlocutory proceedings.\n\nThe hearsay evidence rule for Australia has been described herein in a composed manner. This analysis can often help in dropping criminal charges at an early stage due to lack of evidence.

(43, 'What are the general commercial liability policies in the UAE?', 'insurance_production_8441820_3e32972cd2.jpg', 'Commercial general liability (“CGL”) policies are a norm in the UAE. A CGL policy usually provides comprehensive liability coverage by encompassing different liability coverage under the same head, such a property coverage, personal injury coverage, medical coverage etc.', 'A CGL policy thus endeavors to cover the various liabilities arising from operations, premises, products of a business under one policy. The broadheads covered under a commercial liability policy in the UAE includes:\n\n- **Property Damage**: A CGL policy will cover the instances wherein property damage is caused to another person or company on account of your business operations. The Federal Law No. (5) of 1985 On the Civil Transactions Law of the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE civil code”) defines property as ‘an object or right that has a negotiable value’. A broader description is also provided for ‘property’ under Article 97 of the UAE civil code, which states that, ‘Anything that may be subject to physical or legal possession, maybe exploited lawfully and is not by nature or by law non-negotiable, can constitute the subject matter or proprietary rights. Pursuant to the UAE civil code, any person who damages or destroys the property of another is required to compensate the same, and pay an equivalent value (ref: Article 300).\n\n- **Personal and Advertising Injury**: A CGL policy will cover your business against claims arising for instances of slander, libel, malicious prosecution, wrongful eviction etc. Article 293 of the UAE civil code recognizes the concept of ‘moral damages’ and states that: “i) Damages shall include moral damages. Shall be considered moral damages, trespassing against others in their freedom, honor, dignity reputation social standing or financial position; ii) Spouses and closet relatives of the family may be adjudged damages for the moral prejudice sustained by them as a result of the death of the injured. iii) Recovery of moral damages is not transferable to others unless its amount is fixed by agreement or a final court judgment”.\n\n- **Bodily Injury**: A CGL policy coverage protects you from damages arising out of bodily injury caused to other people or from damages caused to third-party property. Article 299 of the UAE civil code recognizes the concept of compensation for personal injury and states that ‘Damages are compulsory due for prejudice to the person. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, either blood money or compensation for defect of sold value, in cases they are due, may not be added to damages’.\n\nA key difference between different types of CGL policy is the concept of how claims can be raised. For example, a “claim-based policy” allows for claims to be raised during the policy terms regardless of when the underlying claim event occurred. However, on the other hand, a “occurrence policy” strictly goes by the concept of when the claim event occurred and stipulates to honour the claim only if the underlying claim event occurred during the policy term. It is usually seen that CGL policies in the UAE are mostly occurrence-based policies.\n\nIt is important to note that, even though the CGL policy constitutes a very comprehensive policy, it might still not cover all the risks and liabilities connected to a business. It is therefore advisable to conduct a detailed study to ensure that commercial liabilities unique to the business are identified and covered. Suppose the standard CGL policy is seen to lack in its liability coverage. In that case, ‘excess liability coverage’ can be purchased in addition to cover the claims that either exceeds the limit or are not part of the standard CGL policy. For example, a standard CGL policy may exclude from its purview the commercial liability coverage for product recalls or computer-related losses etc. A medical payment coverage may also be added into a CGL policy in order to cover third-party bodily injuries at a higher limit, regardless of the business’s liability or negligence in the incident.', 'what-are-the-general-commercial-liability-policies-in-the-uae', '2022-05-01 04:19:39', '2022-05-07 22:15:19', 1, 5),

Drug Addiction is known as the biopsychosocial disorder which is caused by the same roots and i.e., the induction of psychoactive chemi.', 'Many-a-times people who are addicted to alcohol have the tendency to take their medications with alcohol which can at times backfire them instantly as mixing alcohol and medication together can form a very deadly combination which can be extremely dangerous to consume and can also lead towards the stream leading to the edge of death or overdose. The Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre and the Drug Rehabilitation Centre states that there are many reasons due to which doctors do not allow to mix these two components as they have the ability to alter the changes in the body and can make you feel completely dizzy with giving the urge of even a heart attack. The [Drug & Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre](https://movementofrecovery.org/) states that alcohol usually makes many medications very less effective in nature by coming in between with the need to absorb in the digestive tract of the body, where alcohol also increases the bioavailability of the drug which indeed rises the intensity of the medication in the streams of the blood vessels to be absolute toxic in nature.\n\nAlso, consuming alcohol comes with the issues of having a side effect with medication being absolute worst or creation of even new symptoms in the body which can make you feel sedated and extremely sleepy. This mixture most of the time becomes an opiate with alcohol which also cuts off the supply of oxygen in the body which is known to be the most common reason for death. Thus, when one receives prescription medication or also uses a specific medication for their everyday consumption, people usually primarily ask their doctor regarding the need to consume their medicine with alcohol. Following certain rules where one does not have limits of overdosing or so, one might minimise the amount of medication you are intaking on a regular basis as the risk factor will always be there.\n\nTherefore, when there is an interaction between the two substances mixed with one another, there are a certain type of drugs which allow the change of the body and its response as well with an alcoholic beverage on the side. Some of the intense symptoms can be of change in the mood swings, feeling, emotions and behaviours of the individuals, happening of headaches, dizziness, lack of coordination, having blood pressure changes, nausea and even vomiting too.\n\nTherefore, in many of the cases it is very harsh to mix alcohol with medications which can often lead towards the shadow of getting an overdose or even alcohol poisoning at times as well, which are indeed life threatening to one\'s mind and can also arrange the situation of emergencies as well. The sheer effects of mixing alcohol with medication thus too depends on the major individual factors which can go both in female and in males with intense effects mainly on the older generations as they intake heavy medications at times with alcohol which can indeed backfire them at any time.', 'a-deadly-combination-of-pharmaceutical-drugs-and-alcohol', '2022-05-01 04:26:21', '2022-05-07 22:15:20', 1, 7);

The federal law no. 3 of 1987 and its amendments (the UAE Civil Code) defines the act of providing false reports to judicial or administrative authorities in the UAE as a punishable offence. The punishment can include imprisonment as well as fines. The significant factor checked by the UAE courts in false accusation crimes includes the aspect of ‘bad faith’. In addition, if a false accusation leads to another person being convicted, then the same penalty shall be applied to the fabricator.\n\n**Article 276**, states: Detention, a fine, or one of these two penalties shall be imposed upon any one who, in bad faith, gives a false report to judicial or administrative authorities concerning commission by a person of an act or omission which entails a criminal punishment or administrative disciplinary action, even if no criminal or disciplinary action follows, as well as anyone who, contrary to the truth, fabricates material evidences on the commission of a crime by a person, or caused legal proceedings to be taken against a person, knowing of his innocence. Detention or a fine shall apply to both cases if the fabricated crime is a felony; if the fabrication leads to a criminal judgment, the, fabricator shall be punished by the same penalty.\n\nSimilarly, if a fake claim is based on forged documents, it invites punishments and penalties under forgery. Forgery is defined under the UAE laws as ‘an act that alters the reality of a written instrument in a manner so as to cause prejudice and with the intention of substituting the false alteration for the genuine document’. The punishment for forgery includes imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines. Article 216 of the UAE penal code states seven methods that are considered as committing the crime of forgery, and they include:\n\n1. \"To alter a genuine instrument, whether by adding, or removing or changing any of its written parts, numbers, marks or pictures.\n2. To falsely sign or place a forged seal, or to alter a genuine signature, seal or imprint.\n3. To obtain by surprise or by fraud the signature, seal or imprint of a person who ignores the contents of the instrument or who has not validly given his consent thereon.\n4. To make falsely or imitate an instrument and attribute it to another person.\n5. To fill a blank paper which is signed, sealed or imprinted, without the approval of the person who has signed, sealed or imprinted it.\n6. To assume the name of another person or to substitute it in a document which has been prepared specifically to prove the identity of such other person.\n7. A material alteration of writing with a deceitful and fraudulent intent, preventing therefore the genuine intent of the instrument from being achieved.\"\n\nRaising a fake claim in the UAE is treated as a felony in most instances and may invite punishments for more than one offence, as we discussed above.

According to new research by financial services firm Edward Jones, they have actually been faring far better than their younger counterparts.\n\nThe Edward Jones and Age Wave Study focused exclusively on how different generations have held up emotionally and financially in the months since the lockdowns began, and some of its findings are at least as startling as how quickly even 70-year-olds came to love Zoom.\n\n“COVID-19’s impact forever changed the reality of many Americans, yet we’ve observed a resilience among U.S. retirees in contrast to younger generations,” says Ken Dychtwald, Ph.D., the founder and CEO of Age Wave, a leading research think tank on aging, retirement and longevity issues.\n\nWhile acknowledging upfront that the virus itself disproportionately struck aging adults, the five-generational sampling of 9,000 people, age 18 and over, reveals more than a few surprises. Among them:\n\n- While 37 percent of Gen Zers, 27 percent of Millennials, and 25 percent of Gen Xers say they’d suffered “mental health declines” since the virus hit, only 15 percent of Baby Boomers responded likewise.\n\n- Faring the best were those 75 and over – the Silent Generation that followed the so-called “Greatest Generation” – with a mere 8 percent of those respondents reporting any mental health deterioration. That would seem to run counter, as does the results for Boomers (age 56 to 74), to early warnings that prolonged social isolation made older adults especially vulnerable to depression, anxiety and cognitive decline.\n\n- Nearly 68 million Americans have altered the timing of their retirement due to the pandemic, and 20 million have stopped making regular retirement savings contributions.\n\nDychtwald attributes the two older generations’ resilience to having “a greater perspective on life.”\n\n“They’ve seen wars and other major disruptions before,” he says, “and they know that this, too, will pass. Younger generations feel like, ‘What happened to my life? I mean, I was supposed to go to college or I was starting a new job, and now everything has changed.’”\n\nMost retired Boomers and Silent Gens also had monthly Social Security checks to fall back on. Which explains why – though the pandemic has significantly reduced the financial security of a quarter of Americans – younger generations were slammed the hardest: Nearly one-third of Millennial and Gen Z respondents characterize the impact as “very or extremely negative,” compared to 16 percent of Boomers and 6 percent of Silent Gens who admitted to similar hardship.\n\n**Looking for any silver lining that’s come out of the COVID-19 crisis?**\n\nWell, 67 percent of respondents did say it’s brought their families closer together.\n\n“The pandemic has certainly thrown into sharp relief what matters most in our lives,” says Ken Cella, Edward Jones’s client services group principal. “And important discussions have taken place about planning earlier for retirement, saving more for emergencies, and even talking through end-of-life plans and long-term care costs.”\n\nAnd with the study also showing that an overwhelming percentage of retirees yearn for more ways to use their talents to benefit society, financial services firm Edward Jones believes it’s time to redefine retirement more “holistically” to encompass what it calls “the four pillars” of health, family, purpose and finance.', 'study-shows-older-americans-are-coping-best-during-the-pandemic', '2022-05-01 04:33:29', '2022-05-07 22:15:21', 1, 7),

They want to maintain momentum in the new year, no matter what the market brings.”\n\nFattening retirement nest eggs was among the long-term goals deemed especially important, so much so that 48 percent of respondents say they intended to boost their 401(k) and/or IRA contributions by at least 1 percent of their salary.

Apart from the foregoing, the courts of DIFC and ADGM has signed a memorandum of understanding with English Courts for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. The lack of a bilateral treaty has caused several issues to parties to the suit as the only option left with them is to initiate a claim against the judgment debtor before the courts of England under the common law. Importantly, in order to entertain the claim, the judgment shall fulfill the following requirements:\n\n- The courts issued the judgment (for instance the courts of UAE) shall have exclusive authority to entertain such case;\n- The judgment issued by the foreign court shall be final and binding;\n- The judgment mentions a clear amount of money owed by the judgment debtor;\n\nIf the foregoing is proved by the judgment creditor, there is a possibility of judgment enforcement in the foreign country, however, such enforcement can be challenged on the afore-mentioned grounds or in the event the judgment issued by the court oppose the public policy of the country where the judgment is subjected to be enforced.\n\n## Case Facts\n\nUnder present circumstances of the case (Lenkor Energy Trading DMCC v. Hari) the courts of England considered the judgment rendered by the UAE courts as final and binding despite the challenges or defenses raised by the defendant concerning the judgment opposing the public policy of the country. The courts of England were of the view that a judgment would not offend public policy just because it was issued under a different approach or an approach different from that of English Courts. Henceforth, a defense of public policy can only be considered if the judgment actually offends the policies of the country.\n\nLegal Consultants of Dubai are of the view that this judgment would positively impact the enforcement procedure in UAE. Wherein, the Civil Procedure law of UAE under Article 85 of Cabinet Resolution number 57 of 2018 sets out the procedure for enforcement of foreign judgments in UAE. As apparent from the wordings of the law, the enforcement judgment is generally possible if both the countries have signed a bilateral treaty, however, we may witness a change in this prerequisite in coming years, relying on the current judgment.', 'enforcement-of-uae-court-s-judgement-in-uk', '2022-05-01 04:45:52', '2022-05-07 22:15:24', 1, 5),

Consider a River Cruise in Italy!', 'river_cruise_italy_with_boat_208701_a35e6ef420.jpg', 'If you’re looking to discover the authentic heart of Europe away from the thronging crowds of the cities.', 'If you’re looking to discover the authentic heart of Europe away from the thronging crowds of the cities, why not consider a cruise along some of the continent’s historic waterways? With networks of canals crisscrossing through scenic countryside, picturesque towns and even cities, a river cruise in Italy is one of the best ways to experience a unique perspective of the country. This very relaxed mode of travel takes you away from the fast paced bustle of the cities and roads, but that’s what makes it so special. A hotel barge allows you to get under the skin of a country whilst still enjoying the luxuries of a hotel, plus there’s plenty to do along the way!\r\n\r\n## What to Expect\r\n\r\nA river cruise in Italy promises so many opportunities for relaxation and repose. As the boat moves gently from mooring to mooring, you can sit on deck sipping your favourite drink (made by your in-house barman!) or, if you prefer, you can stroll along the towpath and admire the surroundings. If you are someone who likes activities, there’s also plenty for you to do in that respect on a barge holiday. Each boat carries bikes, so you can cycle along the flat towpath beside the vessel for as long (or as little) as you like. Plus, with stops in villages and towns along the way, you’ll get a chance to shop, explore and visit local restaurants - although, it must be said that the onboard catering is just as good as any restaurant, and way better than many. Whether you’re dying to see the magical canals of Venice, rural Tuscany or fashionable Milan, there’s an Italian itinerary that will appeal to every traveller.\r\n\r\n## Just as Much Fun for the Solo Travellers\r\n\r\n![Men sitting on water body image](men_sitting_adfiajfij32i_34056c3894.jpg)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, while cruising tends to cater for couples, groups and families, solo travellers don’t have to miss out. The best companies offer excellent solo cruise holidays, which are just perfect for the independent traveller. A river cruise in Italy on your own not only means you really get to immerse yourself in the country’s beauty and history, but it’s a great way to meet like-minded people. You might even make a few life-long friends as many of the guests do.\r\n\r\nSolo trips are made extra special with unique itineraries designed to bring the group together and create a sense of camaraderie. So, even if you’re new to travelling alone, you’ll feel part of the gang. You can expect a welcome with a glass of sparkling Prosecco, giving you a chance to break the ice and mingle with your fellow travellers. Whether you’re travelling through Venice or another part of Italy’s stunning waterways, you’ll be treated to special experiences at historic sites as well as enjoying the fun group dinners, created by your gourmet chef.\r\n\r\nExploring Europe on your own is a fantastic opportunity to discover new places that you’ve never thought you’d visit.

There is a certain, haunting soul that you can capture on a saxophone or clarinet that is more di?cult to get on a piano. Despite this, woodwinds are criminally underused in many types of music, and very often, are confined to ‘traditional’ classical music.\r\nBut just listening to classical music can get boring after a while, and many woodwind musicians prefer to play a wide variety of musical styles and genres.\r\n\r\nAs such, we’ve compiled a list of three modern woodwind classics, featuring our favourite hits from jazz, rock, and pop.\r\n\r\n## 1. John Coltrane - Blue Train (1958: Saxophone)\r\n\r\n![john-coltrane-c001d6ecc24.jpg](john_coltrane_c001d6ecc24_57bb01fc6e.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to compile a list of the greatest wind musicians without John Coltrane being somewhere near the top. Blue Train is one of the most talked about jazz albums of the past century, and deservedly so. It o?ers a glimpse into another era and another life: equal parts busy and minimal, chaotic, yet structured. Joyful, but with a hint of melancholy. A nostalgic trip into the past, but one which is so completely timeless that it will never get old or stale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is no surprise that this particular album was written during Coltrane\'s recovery from heroin addiction, just four months after getting clean. There is an air of freshness and wondrous observation about the piece; as if you can just imagine Coltrane composing the melody in a cafe while watching people emerge from the railway station.\r\n\r\nThere is a bustling rhythm to the music that is just so very human, as if you are seeing the life in front of you in a di?erent way. The way you might see it when starting a new life, as Coltrane himself did.\r\n\r\nColtrane’s saxophone is cool, understated, and minimal. Even when he plays the runs and trills, the simplicity of the backing makes the instrument shine. In several parts of the recording, you can hear the breathy, dull sound of the saxophone reed which helps to ground the piece and bring it back to earth.\r\n\r\n## 2. Sidney Bechet - Petite Fleur/Stranger On The Shore (1952: Saxophone)\r\n\r\n![sidney-bechet-6ecc25.jpg](sidney_bechet_6ecc25_cf83a27081.jpg)\r\n\r\n_‘Bechet to me, was the very epitome of jazz.’ - Duke Ellington_\r\n\r\nAlthough a little more traditional in its style than Coltrane\'s jazz, Bechet\'s songwriting is classic and memorable, and o?set by touches of Latin American flair across the piece. Despite its subtlety, there is an inherent passion in Bechet’s playing, which can be heard throughout.\r\n\r\nThe classic melody, in keeping with popular musical values of memorability and simplicity, is o?set by more complex beats and jazz elements, which makes the piece fascinating to listen to while retaining its approachability.\r\n\r\nThis, along with the audible attitude and suaveness of the voice of the saxophone, creates a sense of wistfulness - with a hint of romantic and sexual longing, and the lonely simplicity of the instrument against a minimal background.\r\n\r\nBechet was a groundbreaking musician: in an era where racial (and therefore musical) segregation was the norm, he became the first important jazz artist on record, just a few months before Louis Armstrong rose to fame.\r\n\r\nBechet came from New Orleans, but found the jazz scene in the United States limited and decided to continue his career in France, where he joined La Revue Negre, a show starring popular Black music and talent of the time, including the singer and stage performer Josephine Baker. It was here, in his new home of France that Bechet wrote Petite Fleur.\r\n\r\n## 3. Benny Goodman - In The Mood (Clarinet)\r\n\r\n![benny-goodman-1d6ecc26.jpg](benny_goodman_1d6ecc26_716e80a3fd.jpg)\r\n\r\nKnown as The King Of Swing, Benny Goodman’s In The Mood was immediately popular among white Americans who may not have listened to jazz otherwise. Goodman’s concert at Carnegie Hall in NYC was described by critic Bruce Eder as “jazz’s coming out party to the world of respectable music”.\r\n\r\nWhile this attitude towards Black music is a clear reflection of racial prejudices of the time, Eder does identify the unifying spirit of Goodman’s music. Goodman’s groups were some of the first truly racially integrated bands of the era, and he showed the same values in his personal life at the time, being vocally against any kind of racism throughout his musical career.\r\n\r\nBenny Goodman’s orchestra went on to become one of the most popular bands of the Swing era, and their concert at Carnegie Hall was hailed as the ‘single most important concert in history’ for its influence on popular music at the time.', 'three-modern-woodwind-classics-that-ll-take-your-breath-away', '2022-05-01 12:18:04', '2022-05-07 22:15:24', 3, 6),

It is not simply retribution for bad deeds.', 'Eastern traditions have a complex view on how karma affects our life; it views it as a part of a cycle of birth and rebirth. Our actions and intentions can influence karma, which can be both positive and negative.\n\nThe news of Donald Trump getting sick with Covid-19 caused the word ‘karma’ to trend on social media. The former American President downplayed the virus, openly ridiculed the practice of wearing masks, spread misinformation and organized super spreader events for thousands of followers. But what happened to him soon after was not necessarily karma (or at least, there’s no way to confirm). So chances are, karma isn’t what you think it is.\n\nKarma is not just a system by which the universe brings snarky revenge for someone’s misdeeds. It’s not luck or even destiny. It is a Sanskrit term that translates to ‘action’, ‘work’ or ‘deed’ and in essence, it speaks of the spiritual cycle of cause and effect. The good thoughts and actions you perform lead to an addition of good karma while the bad ones lead to bad karma. Realize that karma does not necessarily have to be negative. It has more to do with the law of consequences than a certain reward or punishment.\n\nThe idea is linked to the notion of samsara, which too originated in India and means ‘wandering’ in Sanskrit. It is integral to Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Taoism and refers to the belief that all living things are meant to go through cycles of birth and rebirth, which are likely to continue indefinitely.\n\nWith the details depending on the religion you follow, the type of karma you gather on the wheel of life or ‘karmic cycle’ can impact both the present and the future, in the current life or the one that’s to follow. The soul traverses after death, bringing karmic impulses from the life just completed into the new one. Conversely, it’s significant to note that the karma you are experiencing today may be a product of your actions not just in this lifetime but even the lives you have lived in the past.\n\nIf you are wondering, being reborn as an animal is considered as an undesirable rebirth as it leads to much additional suffering. Having a human rebirth lands you closer to being able to get off the karmic soul train. But is there a way to escape samsara? Can we do so by working towards achieving enlightenment or ‘nirvana’? Once you get there through spiritual practices and good karmic deeds, your sufferings will dissipate and you will be able to find peace and happiness. Obviously, your physical body will perish and you will no longer be born; but on the up side, you will be awake to the true nature of reality and if you follow Hinduism, you’d reunite with the universal god or soul, also known as Brahman.\n\nIt’s important to point out that the laws of karma, caused by individual actions, affect the life you are leading. But what is equally important are your intentions. They are just as significant in your karmic profile and the effect they have on you. Unintentional actions do not have so much of an influence. Even carrying out good deeds that stem from questionable intentions can bring you negative karma. So if you are in search of karma quotes and sayings, read on to learn how exactly karma works.\n\nThe theory of karma also recognizes two types of karma – phalas and samskaras. Phala is a visible or invisible karmic effect that is immediate or experienced within the current lifetime; whereas samskara refers to the invisible effects that are produced inside you and impact your ability to be happy or unhappy. This applies both to this life and our future lives. While the nitty-gritties of karma theory differ based on which spiritual practice you follow, one thing is for certain – what goes around surely comes around.', 'karma-doesn-t-work-how-most-people-think-it-does', '2022-05-01 12:40:00', '2022-05-07 22:15:25', 3, 5),

Exposure to UV rays and free radical damage results in skin irritation as well.\r\n\r\nDaily skin care is important to get your skin ready everyday, especially when you have a dry skin type. The products you choose must have ingredients that can lock the moisture in, balance the skin pH and prevent the skin barrier. Also, they must prevent the skin from everyday environmental damage. However, choosing the appropriate product for Dry skin is a crucial task.\r\n\r\n**Let’s help you have a simple and fuss free skin care regimen**\r\n\r\n## Double cleansing just saves the day\r\n\r\n![Women skin toner image](women_skin_toner_g1457990a_76b238124b.jpg)\r\n\r\nDouble cleansing your skin aids it to break down dirt and impurities, keeping it balanced and healthy.

But It isn’t easier to choose just the right cleanser when you have dry skin. The product should be hydrating, soothing and skin pH friendly at the same time.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look for these three ingredients in any product, you’ll win the game.

If not, you must include the same.\r\n\r\nExfoliating twice or thrice in a week can get you the best results.\r\n\r\nMandelic or Lactic acid could be an apt choice for those with dry and sensitive skin. Both of them belong to the AHA family. Unlike others, mandelic and lactic acid are gentle exfoliants and an excellent moisturizer making them ideal for sensitive skin types.\r\n\r\nThe exfoliating action of these, removes the dead skin cells, boosts collagen production accelerating the cell turnover.

When it comes to acne and pigmentation issues, serums could be a great choice.\r\n\r\nVitamin-C based serums are best to introduce in your morning skin care regime. Being a natural brightening agent, vitamin-C, lessens blemishes and dark spots on the skin. It increases the infusion of antioxidants to the skin which help in reducing the severity of acne.\r\n\r\nSoothing nature of Niacinamide calms down the irritated skin. When used overnight on a daily basis regulates sebum secretion and heals the skin. You can also opt for alpha arbutin serum, which is known to treat pigmentation, sunspots and breakouts. It is rich in antioxidants that protects and nourishes the skin. Azelaic acid could also be an alternative.\r\n\r\n## Follow up with moisturizer\r\n\r\n![Cosmetics cream roses blossom](cosmetics_cream_roses_blossom_43610_aa1e37a4f1.jpg)\r\n\r\nMoisturizing is an essential step of any daily skin care routine. However, for dry skin types, it should have some special ingredients that could not just keep the skin hydrated but also prevent the environmental skin damage when exposed.\r\n\r\nThese special ingredients are hyaluronic acid and glycerin, as they attract moisture. There should be an apt concentration of oils as well to keep the skin enriched with healthy lipids.

The occasional lazy day is fine, but when they become a regular occurrence, within you, something needs to change.', 'There are going to be days you don’t feel like doing much of anything. The occasional lazy day is fine, but when they become a regular occurrence, within you, something needs to change.\nPeople obtain success and meet their goals through motivating or inspiring themselves to take action each day.\n\nWhether this is just luck of the draw or a learned skill for those lucky few is debatable. However, there is no debate that anyone can learn to be more productive.\n\nTry these tips to motivate yourself and increase the odds of success in your favor:\n\n## 1. Be more willing to fail.\n\nMaybe you’re not being lazy. Maybe you’re procrastinating because you’re afraid of failing. A fear of failure will take the wind out of your sails and begin the process of rationalizing reasons for not doing anything at all. Embrace failure as a regular part of life.\n\n## 2. Remember that life is short.\n\nLife is short, but it’s long enough, as long as you don’t waste time. You can get a lot accomplished between now and the end of your life, but only if you respect your time and make the most of it. It’s easy to put things off until tomorrow, but there are only so many tomorrows left.\n\n## 3. Consider the long-term cost.\n\nWhat is the cost of waiting or not taking advantage of the opportunity before you? It’s easy to see the enjoyment of sitting on the couch for another day. It’s not as intuitive to think about what being lazy will mean a year or more from now.\n\n## 4. Consider the benefit of getting something accomplished.\n\nWhat will you get from going to the gym every day for the next year? What will happen if you don’t go? What do you get from taking action right now? Focus on that instead of the short-term pleasure of being lazy.\n\n## 5. Ask yourself what you could accomplish today.\n\nWhat could you get done today? How would you feel about yourself and your day if you did get a few meaningful things accomplished? Make a list of things you’d like to get done and then follow your list.\n\n## 6. Use a timer.\n\nSpending four hours cleaning out the attic isn’t too appealing but seeing how much you can accomplish in 15 minutes is intriguing. A timer will give you a specific endpoint and focus your attention. You might decide to reset the timer and give it another go after the first round.\n\n## 7. Create goals.\n\nHaving a few short-term goals and long-term goals can make it easier to motivate yourself. It’s not easy to go the gym just for the heck of it. It’s easier to go to the gym if you have a goal of losing five pounds this month, or 50 pounds this year, or looking great for your class reunion.\n\n## 8. Use music, books, quotes, or movies for motivation.\n\nMaybe you have a certain movie scene or song that motivates you. For someone else, it might be a favorite quote. YouTube is full of inspirational videos that only take a few minutes to watch. Start and end the day with something that inspires you to take action.\n\nOne thing that separates successful folks from mere mortals is the ability to get things done on a consistent basis. It’s important to know how to motivate yourself each day. Use the most of each day and avoid wasting too much time. Life is short, so make the most of it. There’s nothing to be gained by being lazy. Find your focus end procrastination without the willpower.', '8-tips-to-motivate-your-lazy-self', '2022-05-01 12:56:08', '2022-05-07 22:15:26', 3, 6),

Bookkeepers maintain accurate company records, financial transactions, and statements.', 'This article provides some tips on how to teach yourself how to become a bookkeeper. It will also give you some information on skills needed to succeed in this profession.\n\n## Roles of a Bookkeeper\n\nTo become a bookkeeper, you’ll first need to understand what a bookkeeper does and the education and skills required to become one. A bookkeeper’s work is to keep track of company finances by creating financial records for all transactions that occur in the company. They also maintain the company’s books and records by calculating taxes and payrolls, paying bills and invoices, reconciling bank statements, preparing financial statements and budgets, and managing investments or other assets such as stocks or bonds held.\n\nThey do this by using accounting software such as QuickBooks or Xero and following generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nAs a bookkeeper, you’ll have different responsibilities depending on the size of your employer. For example, if working for a small business, you might also be responsible for handling payroll or managing inventory. If you work in public accounting, you may also be responsible for preparing tax returns.\n\n## Skills Needed to Become a Good Bookkeeper\n\nThe main requirement for becoming a bookkeeper is knowing how to keep books. A four-year degree in accounting is not required, especially if you possess the following skills:\n\n1. Organized and detail-oriented\n2. High level of accuracy and organization\n3. Ability to handle multiple tasks at once, such as bills and daily transactions\n4. Ability to use computer software and adapt to new programs easily\n5. The terminology and procedures involved in financial record keeping\n6. Basic math skills, an understanding of debits and credits, and a working knowledge of double-entry accounting.\n\n## How to Become a Bookkeeper\n\n### Step 1. Learn Accounting\n\nTo become a bookkeeper, you’ll first learn basic accounting skills. If you don’t know how to balance your checkbook, start there. Learn the difference between a debit and a credit, the difference between cash and accrual accounting, and how to use the various reports generated by accounting software.\n\nYou can practice these skills on software like QuickBooks or Quicken as you learn them. These programs are often available at local libraries or on the internet. Once you feel comfortable with these basic skills, you can seek more advanced training.\n\n### Step 2. Take Free or Low-cost Online Bookkeeping Courses\n\nBookkeeping coursework covers general bookkeeping principles and the specific accounting software used by many businesses. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, trial balance, and journal entries are covered in typical bookkeeping classes.\n\nFree/low-cost bookkeeping courses include\n\n- **Coursera courses**.\nCoursera is a large online learning platform. Many free online courses are available, including courses in accounting and bookkeeping. Most of these courses are done in partnership with other online universities, are accredited, and have certificates of completion. They offer various courses in different subjects. Some of the courses are free, and some are pay-as-you-go. You can learn and expand your knowledge on bookkeeping at Coursera at a minimal expense.\n\n- **Corporate Finance Institute**.\nCorporate Finance Institute is an online community college that offers specialized training in corporate finance, including stock trading and investing. You can learn from the world’s best instructors in just three months. Corporate Finance Institute also offers new students six months of free access to their online course materials. This includes a large selection of free video training courses covering topics such as stock trading and investing and bookkeeping and payroll.\n\n- **Intuit bookkeeping basics**\nIntuit is the bookkeeping division of the software giant Intuit Inc., formerly QuickBooks. The QuickBooks bookkeeping software is a great place to get started with bookkeeping, but if you want to advance your career and learn more advanced techniques, you should consider enrolling in one of the company’s online courses. There are several different courses available, designed for beginners and advanced users. You can learn QuickBooks fundamentals and more advanced topics, such as the payroll module.\n\n### Step 3. Enroll In Internship Programs\n\nYou may also want to look for an internship with a company in your area that uses bookkeepers. This will give you some hands-on experience.\n\nOnce you have completed formal training and gained some practical experience, you will be ready to seek employment as a bookkeeper for a company in your area or even as an independent contractor working from home.\n\nIf you want to go beyond being just a beginner at this or any other skill, and work toward developing a real mastery, then you are going to need a deeper and more powerful strategy. What you need is a way to hack your brain so you can develop a winning mindset.\n\nA winning mindset is a state of mind that allows you to enter a flow state at will. You do this by programming your subconscious mind.\n\nBelieve it or not, most of what you do throughout an average day is NOT freely chosen by your normal waking consciousness even though it may seem that way. The truth is that most of what you do on a day-to-day basis is done on autopilot. An example of this would be when you’re driving your car and as you do so you get bored and begin daydreaming. Before you know it, you find yourself several miles further down the road with absolutely NO memory of having driven those last several miles. So, who exactly was driving while your waking consciousness was in la-la land, and how exactly did you manage to avoid an accident? Your subconscious mind was in control. You already spent years programming your subconscious with how to deal with a broad range of possible driving scenarios and thus it had no trouble taking the wheel while your waking consciousness took a little break. In other words, you were able to take effective actions without having to THINK about them.', 'teach-yourself-to-become-a-bookkeeper', '2022-05-01 13:01:27', '2022-05-07 22:15:27', 2, 8),

Get up early and reap the rewards!\r\n\r\n## Using Side Lighting\r\n\r\n![Light the shade black and white image](light_the_shade_black_and_white_216390_6288431b64.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for strong, graphic contouring (which is particularly effective for portraiture), side lighting can provide a wonderful way to add detail and depth to an image or subject. It can be tricky to get right, however, so you really have to watch from which angle it is coming. Again, simply sitting at a location and consciously observing, then experimenting, is the best way to learn.\r\n\r\n## Indoor Natural Lighting\r\n\r\n![Beach lounge chair image](beach_lounge_chair_860976_2bdb36f5a1.jpg)\r\n\r\nNatural window light can make for absolutely stunning portraits, and positioning your subject in different places has a vast range of effects. The window acts like a softbox, diffusing the light and creating a beautiful softness to the image; as a general rule, the closer your subject is to the window the softer and more even the light will be, but moving them further away will create strong (and often very interesting) contrast.\r\n\r\n## Don’t be Afraid of the Weather\r\n\r\n![Bridge building structure image](bridge_building_structure_gfc14a27e5_1280_eed2ef7130.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you have genuine creative aspirations you need to make friends with all kinds of weather. There are incredible opportunities to be found on rainy and stormy days, but even simply taking advantage of clouds can help you achieve remarkable results. Think of the most moody and evocative landscape images and they were probably shot in what many of us would consider is ‘bad’ weather. Be open-minded, challenge yourself and invest in some decent wet-weather gear!\r\n\r\n## Learn from the Experts\r\n\r\nThere’s no substitute for time and practice if you’re looking to take your skills to the next level, however if you’re really serious, it’s a great idea to enrol in some professional education. An online Joel Meyerowitz course is a very popular option, which allows students to learn at their own pace from one of the most legendary Master photographers on the planet.

(64, 'The Impact of Patient-Tracking Technology on Healthcare', 'technology_on_healthcare_305568_6cef8dc6d0.jpg', 'Technology has so much to offer to the healthcare industry. Things like cost-effectiveness, high-quality health services, user-friendly enrollment/appointment sessions, improved patient experience, or satisfaction are there for the taking.', 'Technology has so much to offer to the healthcare industry. Things like cost-effectiveness, high-quality health services, user-friendly enrollment/appointment sessions, improved patient experience, or satisfaction are there for the taking.\nClinicians, medical billing companies, patients, hence, every stakeholder of the healthcare industry owes it to technology, innovation, and research conducted in this sector.\n\nTracking technology is one of the facilities which seems to assist when implemented intelligently in the healthcare systems. How? Let’s find out!\n\n**The Use of It**\n\nFirst, it was invented to keep track of the supply chain management system. Second, it can do much more than that.\n\nA medical center in California decided to test the system. They asked their patients to wear a tag with a barcode on their wrist. The barcode synchronizes with the software to feed all the location information of the patient.\n\nTo summarize, it is revolutionary in terms of patient management. For instance, on the discharge of a patient, instead of manually notifying the housekeeping department, it sends an automatic notification and updates their records accordingly.\n\nUsing tracking technology merely for this purpose has the potential to help improve patient visits and making their stay in hospitals a breeze. Under MIPS, you can score against the use of this technology through a measure in the Improvement Activities (IA) category.\n\n## Tracking Systems Improve Patient Visits\n\nAnother problem that physicians or nurses face at hospitals is the unnecessarily wandering of patients. By incorporating this patient tracking system, doctors remain at ease even if patients wander off. In short, the staff has to go through lesser hustle.\n\nThus, patients are easy to track. Also, it won’t cost you extra to look for them. Finally, it means more revenue saved at the end of the day, the number one reason to choose provider medical billing companies in the first place.\n\n## Other Benefits of Tracking Technology in Healthcare\n\nOn further investigation by healthcare organizations, they concluded that this technology could track high-risk patients. For each of their visit to the hospital, providers can infuse a check on them, offer them a long-term healthcare plan based on their health conditions.\n\nMoreover, via this method, medical billing companies can have a better system at their hands against patients, eventually, to fully reimburse physicians. There’s also been a program running by the name of PatientPing (Source: NJ Biz) through which multiple healthcare providers are informed about patient visits.\n\nAs groundbreaking as it is, this technology is here to take emergency treatment to another level. Healthcare providers know about medical history instantly. Additionally, it is tailormade to offer a better data-driven healthcare plan for the patient.\n\nIf you talk about the value-based incentive program, scoring for it - MIPS - becomes easy. Issues incurred while incorporating EHR (Electronic Health Record) technology can be solved right away. Usually, they don’t realize the know-how of patient visits. Thus, improving interoperability in general. While we achieve one of the objectives of the Quality Payment Program (QPP), the sooner we implement it, the sooner we grab incentives.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnfortunately, this technology is not very common until now. The relatively new status persists across many healthcare communities. While its usefulness is tremendous, we can only hope for it to be a part of practices. On one side, it improves the patient experience, and on the other, it brings good news for physicians as a quality enhancer. Experiments were successful for its use in hospitals as more than just a tracking system.\n\nBesides, eligible clinicians (ECs) can use this technology to score higher in MIPS 2020 Reporting. Efficient recording of patient visits and transparent and timely communication between physicians improve the performance of medical billing services in the US.', 'the-impact-of-patient-tracking-technology-on-healthcare', '2022-05-01 13:25:54', '2022-05-07 22:15:27', 2, 5),

Why not learn the language? The benefits are profound.', 'Studies indicate that learning a second language can improve your memory, brain function, and concentration and open more opportunities. Learning a foreign language is not hard, and anyone with a strong desire can learn a second language fast. If you are a total beginner and looking for ways to teach yourself a foreign language, you’ve come to the right place.\n\n**Here is a step-by-step guide on how to teach yourself a foreign language as a beginner.**\n\n## Step 1: Figure out Why You Want to Learn the Second Language\n\nThere are many reasons why you can learn a foreign language. It could be because you want to understand the people and their culture for easier relations. Studies indicate that people who speak more than one language reason better.\n\nLearning a second language can help boost your academic achievement. For example, students from non-English speaking countries can learn English to study in institutions located in English-speaking countries. Also, research illustrated that children who spoke a foreign language scored better in academics. Knowledge of foreign languages is also associated with career, social, security, and professional advantages.\n\n## Step 2: Gather All the Necessary Tools for Learning\n\nAfter figuring out why you want to learn the second language, search for all the information and tools required for learning the language. Great examples include:\n\n- **The Internet**\nInternet sources such as Google search and YouTube are among the many sources you can learn a second language. You can practice everyday conversations and listening skills via YouTube. Google search results can help identify popular websites teaching the foreign language. Ensure you search using the right keywords.\n\n- **Physical Books and Digital eBooks**\nMany authors have written interesting books that teach people various languages. Start by buying beginner-level ones and upgrading to advanced levels as you progress with your learning.\n\n- **Software Applications**\nThanks to technological advancements, software developers have created practical language teaching applications to use on your mobile phone or smart device. Visit the Google play store or Apple app store to download and install the app that teaches your preferred foreign language.\n\n## Step 3: Come Up with a Study Plan\n\nNow that you know why you want to study a second language and have acquired all the study tools and material you need, the next step is to create an actionable study plan.\n\nSet some time each day to study your preferred second language.\n\nYou can write your study plan on paper or print it and display it somewhere you can see it. Then stick to the study plan. Commitment and discipline is the key to success in anything you plan to do.\n\n## Step 4: Identify Your Area of Interest\n\nStudying a new language is much easier when focusing on what you love. For example, if you love the Japanese culture and want to learn the language, study it focusing more on the topics covering their culture.\n\nIt would be boring when learning the language through topics like politics. Focus on what attracts you to the language. You can learn the rest later after you learn the basics.\n\n## Step 5: Start the Learning Process\n\nWith everything set, it’s time to start learning. Start by learning a word, phrase, or a few more each day. Avoid cramming as it may erase from your mind fast. Understanding the pronunciation and meaning of the word is what matters.\n\nThe best way to study a new language word or phrase is by practicing writing and speaking it as many times as possible. Also, try to use the word or phrase funnily various times a day during conversations. Your brain will make such memories stick when you repeatedly speak the words or phrases.\n\nWhen you learn the phrase or word, pick a new one the following day and do the same. Ensure you use most of the phrases and words learned every week. After several weeks, you’ll have learned several phrases and words you can’t forget.\n\nThen start constructing sentences using the words you have learned. Where possible, try writing stories or articles using the foreign language. If you have a friend speaking the foreign language, you can request them to assess your proficiency.\n\n## Start 6: Keep Practicing\n\nKeep practicing what you have learned as you get deeper beyond the basics. There are various excellent ways of practicing a new language. For example;\n\n- **Set Your Mind**\nYour mindset is crucial in learning a new language. Accept that you want to learn a second language first. Then embrace it by speaking using the new language. You could talk to yourself to avoid embarrassment as a beginner, but you can engage any native you know when you learn some words and phrases. They could correct and motivate you.\n\n- **Join Meet-Up Groups**\nJoining a local group that speaks the second language would work like magic. The members could be learners like you or natives. You could motivate each other and help solve problems you encounter while learning the language.\n\n- **Certification**\nAfter learning the basics, take tests to gauge your progress. The final test will indicate your proficiency level. Most apps provide a means to test and gauge your proficiency level.\n\n## Step 7: Form a Habit of Using the Language\n\nAfter learning the language, let it not stop there. Form a habit of writing and speaking in the foreign language often, if not all the time. You will gradually become better at it. Keep reading content and watch videos created in that language. Eventually, you will be proficient in writing and speaking.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs illustrated above, learning a second language is not rocket science. It also comes with several benefits, as discussed above. There are many reasons for learning a foreign language. Whichever reason may drive you to learn one, it’s worth the hustle.\n\nRemember, the more you practice writing and speaking using your preferred foreign language, the more you will improve your proficiency. Eventually, you may write or speak like a native within a short period.\n\nIf you want to go beyond being just a beginner at this or any other skill, and work toward developing a real mastery, then you are going to need a deeper and more powerful strategy. What you need is a way to hack your brain so you can develop a winning mindset.\n\nA winning mindset is a state of mind that allows you to enter a flow state at will. You do this by programming your subconscious mind.\n\nBelieve it or not, most of what you do throughout an average day is NOT freely chosen by your normal waking consciousness even though it may seem that way. The truth is that most of what you do on a day-to-day basis is done on autopilot. An example of this would be when you’re driving your car and as you do so you get bored and begin daydreaming. Before you know it, you find yourself several miles further down the road with absolutely NO memory of having driven those last several miles.\n\nSo, who exactly was driving while your waking consciousness was in la-la land, and how exactly did you manage to avoid an accident? Your subconscious mind was in control. You already spent years programming your subconscious with how to deal with a broad range of possible driving scenarios and thus it had no trouble taking the wheel while your waking consciousness took a little break. In other words, you were able to take effective actions without having to THINK about them.', 'how-to-teach-yourself-a-second-language', '2022-05-01 13:52:54', '2022-05-07 22:15:29', 2, 6),

So, what’s next? That’s a bit abrupt beginning sentence for an article, but that’s how it can seem when you get your first e learning content production project. Where do you begin? What kind of final output is needed? What is even possible within the project’s schedule and budget constraints? There are numerous issues to be answered, but one of the most important is, “what type of material will you choose from the various eLearning content types?”\r\n\r\nYou might ask if there is a perfect roadmap for creating relevant and exciting eLearning content. Still, given the unique circumstances of each project, it’s impossible to cover everything in one strategy.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the various factors: **The size of your group, Quantity of content, The topic at hand, The appropriate form of content distribution, The knowledge of the audience Your company’s objectives**\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the various eLearning content types to decide which ones best suit your eLearning project.\r\n\r\n## What Are the Most Popular eLearning Content Types?\r\n\r\n### Slide-based Content\r\n\r\n![Presentation slide image](presentation_slide_g372334986_a99396bb74.png)\r\n\r\nWhen most people hear the term eLearning, they immediately think of slide-based courses. They entail the user participating in a self-paced course in which they examine slides with interactive units and the narration and other multimedia features. These courses frequently resemble PowerPoint presentations in appearance and feel.\r\n\r\nIn a myriad of scenarios, this type of information may be advantageous. Consider using it if you’re looking for a way to:\r\n\r\n- You may already have online learning resources in the form of presentations, documents, PDFs, or other formats that you can quickly convert into an online course.\r\n- You need to convert some offline training to an online version quickly.\r\n- You want to put onboarding new employees on autopilot.\r\n- You need to obtain some fast refresher training on a new product or service.\r\n\r\n### Quizzes\r\n\r\n![Assessment online exam image](assessment_online_exam_education_607864_d584a46dce.png)\r\n\r\nQuizzes, exams, assessments, or knowledge checks – whatever you choose to call them – are an essential part of nearly any eLearning course. Why? Quizzes help you to keep track of your learners’ knowledge and guarantee that you meet your training’s learning objectives. They’re also a fun and interactive method to break up the content in your training modules and provide a natural breakpoint between important subjects that helps learners feel like they’re progressing through the course.\r\n\r\n### Videos\r\n\r\n![Zoom remote meeting virtual image](zoom_remote_meeting_virtual_686113_31404b4402.png)\r\n\r\nVideo content is now viral, and for a good reason: it’s always more interesting than just text or photographs. You can incorporate video content in your eLearning in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\nVideos that can be used in silos: You can only use video as a form of content. You could, for example, make a series of films on a soft skill like conversations during a meeting.\r\n\r\nEmbedded videos: In your eLearning course, you can include videos. The video could feature original content, public domain footage, or stock footage. This methodology has the advantage of allowing you to use video for specific sections while also incorporating more interactive aspects within the course.\r\n\r\n### Interactive Videos\r\n\r\n![Video template website image](video_template_website_youtube_1606945_baaf733977.png)\r\n\r\nLearner apathy or lack of involvement can disadvantage traditional training films, especially in lengthier formats. This is where interactive videos come in handy. We can now deliver video interactions such as hotspots and quizzes thanks to advances in technology. This is the perfect choice when you want to provide consumers the ability to interact with the video’s content by allowing them to click, drag, scroll, hover, gesture, and perform other digital actions.\r\n\r\nSamsung designed an interactive film that takes users through the camera’s various capabilities and navigation buttons.

Starting from school students making their school projects to sales associates and business people who make their daily reports too.\n\nThere are many tips and tricks that people in business should learn to give outstanding presentations. We can always learn from online PowerPoint Free Course about all the information.\n\n - **Avoid unnecessary information**\nWe should be short and precise in our presentation instead of adding unnecessary information. We should not keep talking in the slides and rather keep it limited.\n\n- **Keep It Legible**\nWe must not use a font style and size that is small. Let us all keep the font size readable and make it visible to all so that no one has difficulty reading the data.\n\n- **Make the pictures graphical**\nPictures are of pioneer importance, and if they are visible and clear enough in the slides, then there will be no need for anything to make others understand what we want to make others understand from our falls.\n\n- **Let the font style remain the same**\nThere is no point in changing the font style, colour and shape and causing trouble to the eye of the slides, and the people would be irritated to see the falls.\n\n- **No fancy special effects**\nSince business slides are more about discussion and less about showing off, there is no point in providing elaborate special effects as that will not serve the purpose of the falls. It will simply waste time and will stop the natural flow of discussion.\n\n- **A soothing background track**\nA soothing background track is eligible to bring on professionalism, and as the speaker describes the slides, it would help keep the environment amiable.\n\n- **Be at par with the slides**\nWhile we talk about a particular slide, we should not keep speaking about one part and let the rest of the slides pass. It would be perfect if both our discussion and the slides moved together.\n\n- **Start with a bang**\nWhen we start a presentation, let that be with some slight animation. If the slides are animated, the viewers develop interest and listen to the speaker for the greater good.\n\n- **No “timed presentation”**\nWhen we want to show the slides and discuss them, we should maintain them manually. Let us not put them on a timed presentation as there will be lots of questions and answers based on that. So, we don’t want the details to move away. \n\n- **Keep relevant data**\nThe data in the slides should be relevant to the topic on which we are making the presentation. Adding extra irrelevant data makes the audience bored.\n\n- **Simple background**\nThe slide background should be light and visible for all to see, and it is far more effective than the dark coloured slides. The text is written can be of a dark colour for everyone to see.\n\nThese are some of the most important tricks and tips that help people conduct business presentations.', 'power-point-free-course-tips-and-tricks-for-business-presentations', '2022-05-01 14:04:28', '2022-05-07 22:15:30', 2, 6),

However, problems in performance with large data applications may appear. That’s why optimization of MySQL database is important.', 'An open-source database application that is quite popular and helps store structured data in an accessible and valuable manner is known as MySQL. However, problems in performance with large data applications may appear. That’s why optimization of MySQL database is important.\n\n## Balancing the hardware resources\n\nMySQL performance tune can be optimized by balancing the hardware resources. For this, you have to follow these aspects-\n\n## Storage\n\nStorage should be evaluated. If you want to improve the performance, then up-gradation to SSD (solid-state drives) should be done from HDD (traditional hard disk drives). You can monitor the rates of your disk input and output by using special tools from sysstat packages such as SAR or IOTOP. It is better to upgrade to more and faster storage if disk usage is more than other resources usage.\n\n## Processor\n\nYou can measure MySQL performance tuning and how fast your system will perform by considering processors. You can know the breakdown of how resources perform by using the Linux top command. Ensure the percentage and processes of MySQL processor. Upgradation is important if there’s a bottleneck in your CPU. It can be expensive to upgrade processors.\n\n## Memory\n\nMySQL database storage server can tell the amount of RAM in the database in your memory. You can improve the performance by adjusting the memory cache. Your system performance will be damaged adversely if your memory isn’t optimized or when you don’t have sufficient memory. You can upgrade if your server runs short of memory by adding more. Otherwise, it will result in data catching that can slow down performance. \n\n## Don’t use MyISAM, instead use InnoDB\n\nMySQL database uses an old database-style previously called MyISAM, which is not an advanced database design and is less efficient. Instead, use InnoDB, which has advanced and modern features in-built optimization techniques. It keeps data in pages and makes use of a clustered index. It stores pages in physical blocks consecutively. Thus you can keep relevant data on your device. InnoDB moves a value to a new location if it’s too big for one page and then starts indexing the value. In this way, drive can take less time to access data.\n\n## Using the latest version of MySQL\n\nIt is important to enquire MySQL version and update it to the latest version. This helps to enhance the performance. MySQL performance enhancement is better to use than configuration files and scripting files.\n\n## Optimize queries\n\nSQL queries have to be optimized. Your system operation will be affected if any rogue SQL query is present as it becomes pricy. To optimize queries, you should emphasize indexing. With the help of an index, data can be easily accessed in tables and stored in databases.\n\n## MySQL should not be used as a queue\n\nIt is important to ensure that MySQL should not be used as a queue in case of consecutive operations. This may cause a slowing down system where the parallel running of operations may even occur. It will result in inefficient databases.\n\n## Check scalability problems\n\nSome systems do better scaling than others. In the case of serialized processes, scalability will be limited as more processes will be added, which will wait for others. You have to recognize scalability problems and avoid any cross-talk. It is recommended to unlock everything and also keep things parallel.\n\n## Query the cache\n\nMySQL query cache helps in improving the performance as data is allowed to be stored and readily accessible. When you store a query, and in the future, a similar query is received by the system, results will be returned faster. Thus, with the help of catching, you can increase MySQL cache optimization.', 'how-to-optimize-my-sql-database-performance', '2022-05-01 14:18:04', '2022-05-07 22:15:31', 4, 4),

Enterprises are adopting the IoT for the benefits offered, e.g., operations optimization, cost reduction & improved efficiency.\n\nIoT development & adoption are driven by multiple factors, including readily available low-cost sensors, increased bandwidth & processing power, wide-spread usage of smartphones, availability of big data analysis tools & scalability of IPV6. Organizations are also focusing on external benefits, such as: generating revenues from IoT-enabled products, services, & customer experiences. The diagram to the left illustrates the interconnection among various subsystems in a typical IoT application.\n\nUnique Characteristics & Requirements of IoT Systems Quality Assurance (QA) organizations are wise to view software testing beyond devices & sensors. Huge volumes of data generated across a smart ecosystem add great technical complexity, demanding a holistic approach. IoT applications have several unique factors:\n\n- Combination of hardware, sensors, connectors, gateways, & application software in a single system\n\n- Real-time streaming analytics / complex event processing\n\n- Support for data volume, velocity, variety, & veracity\n\n- Visualization of large-scale data\n\n**Testing Challenges for IoT Applications Primary challenges:**\n\n- **Dynamic environment**\nUnlike application testing in a defined environment, IoT solutions have a very dynamic environment with millions of sensors & different devices used in conjunction with intelligent software.\nReal-time complexity: IoT applications have multiple, real-time scenarios & its use cases are extremely complex.\n\n- **Scalability of system**\nCreating a test environment to assess functionality, scalability & reliability is challenging.\n\n**Other operational challenges:**\n\n- Related subsystems & components owned by third-party units\n\n- Complex set of uses cases to create test cases & data\n\n- Hardware quality & accuracy\n\n- Security & privacy issues\n\n- Safety concerns\n\nAddressing IoT Application Testing Complexities A comprehensive test plan strategy requires various types of testing, test lab setup, tools & simulators to be deployed.Considering the difficulties in generating big data from the thing in a testing environment, it is crucial to evaluate data simulation & virtualization techniques. Stubs can be considered as options during early stages while data recorders can serve as alternatives at later stages. Beyond test planning & data simulation, metrics-driven, exhaustive test execution is performed to achieve a stable system. QA organizations can split IoT test areas into the two layers described below.\n\n**The Device Interaction Layer**\n\nThis layer is where the software & the hardware components of a real-time IoT environment interact. One typical example is a BLE device transmitting real-time data to a mobile device app. There is often a lot of interaction testing occurring on the functional side of QA. However, other types of testing could also be required in addition to typical software testing:\n\n- **Conformance with standards**\nThese are mostly device performance attributes specific to devices & sensors. These attributes must be validated against the standards of the device & its communications protocol. Hardware vendors perform most of these tests, but there could be certain domain or use-case requirements for an environment that was not tested.\n\n- **Interoperability**\nThe ability of different devices to support the required functionality among themselves, other external devices & implementations.\n\n- **Security** With billions of sensors being deployed, it’s crucial to tackle data privacy & security concerns across the IoT ecosystem. The following are the different types of security testing requirements:\n  1. Identity & authentication\n  2. Data protection\n  3. Data encryption\n  4. Storage data security in local machines & in the cloud\n\nThe User Interaction Layer This layer is the touch point between the thing & user. The success of the overall system depends on user receiving a seamless experience. Key tests in this layer include:\n\n- **Network capability & device level tests**\nThe specific aspects of network communication & connectivity are validated by simulating different network modes, as well as device level validation.\n\n- **Usability & user experience**\nUsability & user experience are important in terms of the real-time usability; it involves human / machine interaction & the real-time experience the IoT system provides in a specific interaction.\n\n- **The IoT services & back-end IoT environment**\nWhile integration testing of the interfaces is key, there is a complex data layer that comes into play.\n\nCreating a QA environment to enable validation of such an interface means addressing the growing data volume challenges of the IoT deployment. The front-end validation environment can be realized by assembling data recorders & simulators. The service & data layer validations will involve complex simulation services, such as the generation of millions of sensor hits, machine learning algorithms & the ability to generate time-boxed traffic.\n\nThere are methods to create such an ecosystem, e.g., leveraging sandboxes of development services or creating mock environments using virtualization tools.

Today, if your business isn\'t online, you’re risking losing a vast number of potential customers. At the same time, it’s critical to enhance your online presence and employ several marketing tools for bigger saturation. In other words, to succeed, you need to take advantage of multiple resources. It means, having a qualified website now is not enough for an excellent performance.', 'For that reason, more and more businesses employ different digital products to promote themselves. It includes social media networking, digital platforms, and web applications. However, with such a big range of components, it can be hard to manage them all at once to achieve consistency. Hopefully, there are several ways, and one of the most efficient ones is the use of headless CMS.\n\nEssentially, headless CMS is a back-end-only content management system. It allows using one back end to manage multiple “heads” (front end) that make content accessible via an API on any device, without the need for a built-in front-end layer. That helps solve the problems of content management across different platforms and web apps the business employs. Thus, the content is stored and edited at once place and regardless of the technical side solutions and changes of its presentation on the customer hardware. All in all, headless CMS acts as a repository, which significantly facilitates content management across various platforms.\n\nGiven that headless CMS helps to manage the content across several platforms, the resources spent on development are significantly lower than if the management was carried out from different APIs. And that is not the only advantage of headless CMS:\n\n- **All-round approach**\nWith such omnichannel content management, it’s possible to use the universal content in the interface of different digital products and platforms.\n\n- **Reduced development expenses**\nNo doubt, headless CMS is cheaper to install and configure than hire professionals who will constantly develop the content from scratch for different platforms.\n\n- **High release and launch speeds**\nWith a headless CMS, it is easier to launch websites or web applications because it doesn’t take developing from scratch, which naturally takes more time and effort.\n\n- **High security and protection**\nWhen working with headless CMS, only statically generated files can be accessible for the users, and chances of being hacked through a direct database are very low.\n\nAlthough the list of headless CMS benefits is vast, it doesn’t mean it is a fit-it-all solution. And before applying it to your performance, you need to examine its drawbacks and restrictions.\n\nThe first and the most significant one is that if you want to optimize the ready-made back end for multiple platforms, you will need professional aid. There are many competent headless CMS development New York firms to refer to. But if you’re on a budget, it can be difficult to find a professional to help you with that.\n\nAlso, if you have a blog or another information website, when employing a CMS you will get more troubles but not simplified content management. That is because its architecture and implementation can be too complex for an average user. Thus, you will get a sophisticated solution instead of an enhanced one.\n\n**If the environment of your digital product allows you to use CMS, you need to be aware of its processes and steps:**\n\n- **Conduct a business analysis**\nBefore taking any decision, it’s critical to perform thorough business research to escape any significant expenditures during the process. In other words, it’s essential to measure your financial opportunities before hiring headless CMS development New York professionals.\n\n- **Generate the development plan**\nWithout proper planning, it’s almost impossible to succeed. Thus, you need to generate a thorough plan, making sure you won\'t miss anything.\n\n- **Implement quality testings**\nAfter the work is done, you need to ensure that everything works properly. For that reason, employ quality tests and ensure there are no bugs or any significant problems that can damage your performance.\n\nAnother important thing to know before making the decision is that headless CMS development can’t be performed by an average user. The reason is that this is a professional service created by programmers for programmers. Although headless CMS can be free to install, it can’t boast an easy setup installation process. Thus, you will need an experienced team to work with it.\n\nAll in all, if you want an excellent content management system that will work seamlessly across various devices, headless CMS is the best option.', 'what-is-headless-cms-development-and-when-do-you-need-it', '2022-05-01 14:58:21', '2022-05-07 22:15:34', 4, 3),

To focus on their performance, they prefer to settle it via sports mediators when they have issues with a player, sponsor, or team management. And this gives them several advantages that would be otherwise impossible in case they adopt sports arbitration. Let’s look at these benefits one by one.', 'The habits of people have changed considerably at sporting events. You find many people that primarily do not look at their surroundings at all. They seem to be looking at their smartphones and electronic devices as if someone is talking to them already. Other than this, some people cannot take their eyes off mobiles because they read emails or watch videos or play games. And as finding such people is an everyday routine, we should embrace the fact that life has become very fast. Otherwise, such curiosity could not become such a norm. Another aspect of this fast-paced life is that face-to-face communications have become a thing of the past. Even direct and straightforward messages can be interpreted in complex and sensitive ways. Sports people are well-aware of this situation. To focus on their performance, they prefer to settle it via sports mediators when they have issues with a player, sponsor, or team management. And this gives them several advantages that would be otherwise impossible in case they adopt sports arbitration. Let’s look at these benefits one by one.\n\n## Sports Mediation Saves Money and Time\n\nAlthough the service fees of mediation attorneys are equal to the expenses of expert attorneys at labor law, the process of sports mediation takes much shorter than arbitration would take. And this time saving also means less spending on attorney fees due to their reaching quick settlements through mediations. As a result, the players free themselves from various legal hassles to avoid severe penalties on time.\n\n## Mediators Control Outcomes Unlike Unpredictable Juries\n\nThe number of people in a jury is different, and each of them has his own beliefs and perspectives. So then, while the judge agrees with you, the jury can have a different opinion, and even if one juror has a distinct and harsh opinion that goes against you, this will become made public. And the final decision of the type of take-it-or-leave-it-like creates misunderstandings of the extent to which players cannot concentrate during play-offs. In contrast, the mediators mediate to resolve the disputes with a resolution agreeable to both parties. And the mediators further ensure the privacy of information. Certain parts or the whole details of a dispute resolution process can be kept secret that would otherwise reach the public domain during sports arbitration.\n\n## Changing Positions Is Possible\n\nThe mediators can mutually agree to propose agreeable positions to their parties, and the parties are free to accept or reject their suggestions to resolve a dispute quickly. However, if the parties agree to change positions for a quick settlement, the conflict resolves, with only final decisions made public. Moreover, even if the final decision has come out, both parties choose whether to choose or reject the conclusion reached at the end of a mediation process. \n\nSo, suppose the sports mediators have experience in resolving sports disputes. In that case, they can use their past experiences to walk their clients through complex situations to drive to resolutions agreeable to all.\n\nSo that is why the first choice of most sportspeople is mediation at the earliest stages of a dispute with another party. However, if both parties get entrenched into their positions during mediation, reaching a dispute resolution is not possible through mediation. In such a case, either party can drive the other party to sports arbitration.', 'three-reasons-why-sports-mediation-is-better-than-sports-arbitration', '2022-05-02 02:21:14', '2022-05-07 22:15:34', 5, 9),

However, these subtleties can gigantically influence your chances to win matches and, by and large, to play better badminton.\n\nThis article will give you nine clues that you most likely will not have found out about beforehand. At whatever point applied, these tips will help convey your game to a more significant level. Some of them are clear and adequately pertinent. Others require a pinch more work. Regardless, all of them are, at whatever point applied precisely, accommodating.\n\nMight you want to improve your badminton coordination? By then, make sure to seek after Badminton Famly+ by clicking here. Set up by past World Champion Thomas Laybourn, Badminton Famly+ is the best web planning stage for badminton.\n\n## Tip 1 – The two handles are the primary basic ability to dominate\n\nIn badminton, everything starts with the grips. On the off chance that you don\'t use the correct handles, you will, after a short time, hit an incredible obstacle in your progression. For what reason could that be? Since the grip is an imperative part of playing out your shots effectively. Without a good hold, your ability to make power and precision in your shots will truly decrease.\n\nFirst, you need to focus on two sorts of the handle, as they are the most used and ordinary. Then, when your level begins raising, you will need to add altogether more subtleties to these two kinds of the handle. Notwithstanding, you ought to at first do these two holds perfectly.\n\n- **Forehand handle – The most used and critical hold**\n\nThe forehand handle is the most used and critical hold. It is used when you hit the transport in the side of the body where your racket arm is. For example, on the off chance, you are right given, all of the transports on the right half of your body will be hit while using a forehand handle. If you are left-given, it will be the left 50% of your body.\n\nTo have a good forehand handle, you need to put your hand like you planned to shake somebody\'s hand. At that point, keeping that position, you need to put your hand in the lower end of the handle of your racket. Here, the racket head should be inverse to the floor. This is fundamental because, else, you will not make any difference in characteristics to your shots. \n\nOn the off chance that you have been persistently holding the racket with some unsuitable handle, changing to this grip will feel unnatural, and undoubtedly, your game will fall apart at the beginning. Regardless, it would help if you kept working on your game with this hold until it transforms into the standard handle. At that point, something different, your drawn-out progress will persevere.\n\n- **Strike handle – The Achilles\' effect point of most badminton players**\n\nThe striking handle will, as a rule, be a wobbly part for most badminton players, even in beginner conditions. This issue can look like spillage in a submarine, destroying your whole game.\n\nTo have a fair strike handle, you need to hold the racket out of the blue contrasted with the forehand hold. This can be fairly jumbling close to the beginning, and you may encounter issues in changing, starting with one hold then onto the next. In any case, with time, you will need to do it quickly and without thinking about everything.\n\nThe single resemblance between the two kinds of the handle is that, with the strike hold, you similarly have your thumb on one side of the handle and the other four fingers on the contrary side. Along these lines, this grip can moreover be depicted as finishing an \"endorsement\" around the handle, yet having the four fingers to some degree detached so that, ultimately, the pointer and the thumb are at commonly a comparative height.\n\n## Tip 2 – Focus on your footwork to have the alternative to shoot pleasing shots\n\nAnyway, huge as the hold of your racket, possibly your footwork. Amateurs will, by and large, go running, starting with one spot of the court then onto the next, contributing a great deal of energy and time at the same time. To get an edge on badminton, you need to rehearse and overwhelm the fundamental footwork that will allow you to move around the court.\n\nYou will need to show up at the van\'s circumstance speedier with extraordinary footwork, which will simplify your shots and all the more impressive. Likewise, you will consume less exertion doing it. This is essential if you should play badminton more really than basically on your porch.\n\nThe stray pieces of footwork are essential but saved a huge load of exertion from overwhelming. But, on the other hand, using suitable footwork feels unusual and moderate, and the beginning will eventually have an unfathomable outcome.\n\nDependent on your stature, you may need to use pretty many walks to show up at the corners. However, when you fathom the number of steps you need, you should practice and practice and practice until it seems like the most trademark technique for moving around the court. It takes a lot of preparation. In any case, it is great on the off chance that you need to play badminton at a fair level.\n\n## Tip 3 – An anticipated game plays off more than two or three charm stunts\n\nAt the tenderfoots level, people, generally, don\'t overwhelm coordinates anyway, lose them. What do I mean by that? I infer that the number of centres added to the scoreboard due to a stumble is more conspicuous than the number of centres added to the scoreboard in light of a victorious shot.\n\nIn an enthralling book that isn\'t known, Simon Ramo, a specialist, and investigator examines how tennis players can improve their chances of winning by endeavouring to avoid messes up instead of endeavouring to score centres.\n\nThe book, Extraordinary tennis for the basic player, can be bought on Amazon here. Even though the thought isn\'t as mind-boggling in badminton, everything considered in tennis are as yet an intriguing and accommodating admonishment.\n\n## Tip 4 – Practice your organization. It won\'t overwhelm your matches, yet it will help you not to lose them.\n\nThe organization is probably the most disparaged shot in badminton at the beginners level. This is likely because you do it once in each rally and don\'t win any core interest. Even though you may not notice it, terrible help will make you lose matches. That is since, in such a case that your organization is deficient, you will start each point you are giving a significant burden.\n\nIf each long serve you do in singles twists up closer to the focal point of the court than to the back, you will be giving your adversary an immense advantage as he/she will shoot from a significantly more helpful position.\n\nIf each short serve you do in copies wraps up unreasonably high silly, you will give a significant advantage to the following couple, which will start each point you present with the drive that is so fundamental in winning duplicates matches.\n\nFurthermore, how should you improve your serve? In reality, the key is getting the nuts and bolts right, and after that, practice, practice and practice. Once more, you can check our badminton organization the executives for more information.\n\n## Tip 5 – The best protection is a respectable attack, especially in duplicates matches\n\nYou may have heard that sentence in various games, yet the proverb similarly sounds legitimate in badminton, especially when we talk about sets. As we referred to in our badminton techniques article, attacking is fundamental in case you need to transform into a powerful copies badminton player. This is fundamental since keeping the drive is the best method to win duplicates of matches.\n\nIn singles, this is furthermore self-evident. Be that as it may, make an effort not to be as uncommon about searching for the drive, as there is essentially more space for mending and various techniques. Also, on account of the court is covered only by one individual, you can similarly gain an advantage by moving your enemy around, which doesn\'t happen in copies.\n\nLike this, use this tip carefully in singles, yet proceed enthusiastically in copies. It might be ideal if you appreciated that duplicates is about the drive and that most centres are won while attacking. If you don\'t sort out some way to have or recover the drive in many centres, you will probably lose the game.\n\n## Tip 6 – Always return to the base position\n\nMoreover, persistent returning to the base point is a fundamental capacity you need to rule to improve your badminton coordinate. Why is this so huge? To start with, it keeps you for each situation satisfactorily near all the court so you can remain mindful of the show. Second, if you don\'t return to the point of convergence of the court, it is very basic for your adversaries to keep the drive of the gathering and direct their shots to the farthest point away from your current position.\n\nThis tip ought to be developed alongside tip number 2, the footwork as broad aptitude. Without respectable footwork, it will not be useful for you to return to the base point advantageously reliably.\n\nRegardless, you can have incredible footwork; in any case, on the off chance that you don\'t have the penchant for persistently returning to the centre, you will sometimes remain in the position where you hit the last shot. By doing that, you will be giving your foe a huge advantage in the show.\n\n## Tip 7 – Keep a nice body balance\n\nKeeping a nice body harmony can be incredibly stunning once you start moving all by and by the court. The van moves uncommonly speedy, and you need to keep your position straightforwardly to have the alternative to hit the transport sensibly. If you can\'t keep a good body balance, you will hit frustrating shots whenever the situation gets to some degree confounding.\n\nThe ideal way to keep a good body balance is to use your non-racket arm as a changing segment. With it, you can guarantee that your trunk stays upstanding.', 'badminton-tips-7-tips-to-become-a-better-badminton-player', '2022-05-02 02:32:26', '2022-05-07 22:15:34', 5, 9);

Some would argue that since cannabis can make it difficult to focus and reduce coordination, it would hinder athletes’ performance rather than enhance it. However, not every cannabis user experiences those effects to the same degree, and cannabis can also reduce anxiety, which can be useful in high-pressure environments. Rather than using cannabis to boost performance during an event, though, most 420-friendly athletes use it during recovery.\n\n## How Cannabis Speeds Recovery\n\nTo compete in any sport at the highest levels, athletes need to push their bodies extremely hard. Injuries – minor ones, at the very least – are almost inevitable. Cannabis is a powerful anti-inflammatory, which means it can help with common injuries like over-strained muscles and sprained ankles. It also reduces the duration of post-workout muscle soreness, which could help athletes spend more time training productively and less time recovering.\n\nFor athletes who need to maintain a certain calorie intake but struggle to eat enough, cannabis can help by stimulating their appetites. Athletes may also use cannabis for better sleep. Interestingly, studies have shown that male athletes are more likely to use cannabis than female athletes, and there is a strong positive correlation between number of training hours and frequency of cannabis use.\n\nIt’s also important to note that a majority of cannabis use among athletes may be completely unrelated to their performance. One study found that recreational use was eight times more prevalent among athletes than use for performance-enhancing purposes. \n\n## Which Sports Allow Cannabis Use?\n\nUnfortunately, just because cannabis is legal in an athlete’s state or province doesn’t mean they can use cannabis without repercussions. Beyond actual laws, sport bodies also have their own rules that govern athletes’ behavior. The World Anti-Doping Agency currently includes cannabis on its Prohibited List, as it considers cannabis to be a performance-enhancing drug. Specific sports’ rules are:\n- **Lacrosse**: cannabis use is prohibited.\n\n- **Football**: the CFL’s drug-testing policy has never included cannabis.\n\n- **Hockey**: cannabis use is allowed by the NHL, and testing positive for cannabis during one of the random drug tests is not grounds for fines or suspensions.\n\n- **NBA**: the NBA forbids cannabis use… officially. However, tests are infrequent and it is speculated that up to 80% of NBA players use cannabis anyway.\n\n- **NFL**: like the NBA, the NFL forbids cannabis use, but doesn’t test frequently.\n\n- **MLB**: in Major League Baseball, drug tests are only conducted if there is probably cause. For this reason, players almost never incur penalties for cannabis use, and use is probably much more common than is reported.\n\nBased on the relaxed “anti-weed” policies held by many of these sport bodies and the correlation between time spent training and frequency of cannabis use by athletes, it seems like both athletes and regulators are arriving at the same conclusion: that cannabis may be a useful recovery supplement, but should not be classified as a performance-enhancing drug. Over time, cannabis use bans will probably relax or dissolve.\n\n', 'cannabis-in-sports', '2022-05-02 02:44:33', '2022-05-07 22:15:37', 5, 10),

It was a battle of good with evil, all or nothing.\n\n\"Maybe they\'re friendly?\" asks Paolo Maldini at the beginning of this legendary Nike ad . And Eric Cantona gets a condemning look. From the first moments, it really seems that the stars are in big trouble: Luis Figo is barely escaping crushing, Rui Costa is knocked out in the air fight with his elbow knocked out, Ian Wright is treated to a stomach with a kick. If an Englishman dares to demand the right from a judge, he will face it face to face.\n\nA moment later, four hell demons are already attacking Jorge Campos\' goal. The Mexican is not a cardboard boy, of course, and rushes to the rescue to save the world, but before that he arrives in Maldini with a measured slip. After tackling, he takes two more opponents out of the game with accurate diagonal passing, thus launching an attack that will help save the world. Goodness wins again.\n\nMaldini’s character emerges most clearly from this 90-second valve - a maybe gentleman who, at first glance, even in masks, has a positive attitude towards the inhabitants of hell, but when it comes to the game, it is robotically analytical and surgically accurate.

It is also one of the easiest sports to play. One just needs a fluffy ball and a net only to enjoy the charms of football. But since people now have become busier, they cannot play football due to time constraints. But still, they can enjoy the beauty of football. It is seen among many football fans that they follow both online and offline viewing of football matches. But in the times of the Covid pandemic, the viewership of online football matches has increased drastically. \n\nSo let us see the benefits of watching football online:\n\n**1. Less Time Taking**\n\nWatching football on online platforms saves a huge amount of time. When you plan to watch the football match physically, you first invest time to buy tickets, and in tight fight matches, even tickets booking takes a lot of time. Then going to the stadium, finding the seat, all these processes take a lot of time. During the match and even after the match, you drive back home, just spending your precious time. So it is better to watch the game online than to see it physically.\n\n**2. Online Viewing Gives a Better View of the Game**\n\nIf you are watching the game in the stadium, your focus is very limited. You cannot see the main player all the time due to distance. But if you are watching football online, you automatically get the best view without any extra effort, and that too in crystal clear ultra-high definition. Also, you get all the attractions in the stadium at your fingertips, on your smartphone\'s display. \n\n**3. Statistics of Each Player**\n\nYou can get the lifetime statistics of every player on the field if you are watching the football game online. But you will not get the same when you are physically present at the stadium. It is also a boon for real fans of the game.\n\n**4. Saves Money**\n\nIf money is not everything, it is also not less than anything. We all strive for more and more money, and if you want to save real money and that too without doing anything, even you will rejoice, watch your favorite game, football, online. Because these days, ticket prices are booming and have increased dramatically, whereas online streaming subscription rates are very low and affordable. So it will be recommended to you to buy a subscription of football online rather than to go to the stadium and watch physically.\n\n**5. Convenience**\n\nThere is no convenience in watching football at the stadium. If you want to go to the bathroom, it becomes very difficult. Whereas watching football online is very convenient, you can watch it anywhere you want. No matter where you are, which smartphone you have, you will have access to the thrill of the football match.

(92, 'What are the Punishments for Physical Assault In Public?', 'tingey_injury_law_firm_ve_Nb0_D_Degz_E_unsplash_51f0b60e70.jpg', 'Understanding ‘Assault’: An assault is an ‘act of inflicting physical harm on another person’. Depending on the gravity of the offence and its underlying circumstances, legal recourse to an action in tort, criminal prosecution, as well as civil liability can be adjudged. The United Arab Emirates categorizes ‘assault’ as a violent crime wherein even the threat of an assault can be actionable under the criminal laws. The underlying factors surrounding the offence and the veracity of the damage caused to the other party are taken into consideration.', 'Different categories of assault and their punishments:\n\nThe Federal law no. 3 of 1987 concerning promulgating the penal code and its amendment (UAE Penal Code), categories ‘assault’ into various types, such as:\n\n- **Assault causing death**\n\nA person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, whoever assaults the body safety of others, by any means without intention to kill him but the assault resulted in the death of the victim (Article 336). If the intention to cause death is established, the provisions of this article will not apply, and more stringent punishment will be imposed.\n\n- **Assaulting causing permanent disability**\n\nA person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding seven years, whoever deliberately causes to another a ‘permanent disability’. ‘Permanent disability’ is defined as ‘the type of disability when the injury results in severance or dismemberment of an organ or its partial amputation or the loss or diminution of use thereof, or to permanent total or partial failure of the functioning of any senses’(Article 337). Further, a person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, whoever assaults by any means the body safety of others and the assault results in unintended permanent disability.\n\n- **Assault under the influence of alcohol**\n\nA person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years if the offender is under the influence of intoxication or stupefaction and assaults by any means the body safety of others, and the assault results in unintended permanent disability. (Article 338).\n\n- **Assault resulting in disability**\n\nA person shall be sentenced to detention and to fine, whoever assaults by any means the body safety of others and the assault resulted in his illness or disability to attend to his personal business for a period exceeding twenty days. The penalty shall be detention for a term not exceeding one year and to a fine not in excess of ten thousand Dirham, if the assault did not reach the degree of seriousness mentioned in the above paragraph.\n\n- **Assault on a pregnant woman**\n \n In case the assault is perpetrated on a pregnant woman resulting in abortion, this shall be considered an aggravating circumstance with severer punishment that will be imposed on the perpetrator (Article 339).\n\nCommitting assault in the UAE can thus result in either being charged with a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the veracity of the offence, underlying circumstances and aggravating circumstances relating to the crime. A medical report should be obtained by the victim to record the injuries sustained as a result of the assault. Apart from criminal actions, a victim of a physical assault may also take recourse to a civil claim for damages sustained.', 'what-are-the-punishments-for-physical-assault-in-public', '2022-05-02 03:19:11', '2022-05-07 22:15:40', 1, 5),

As employment in almost all states in the US is ‘at will’ - means your employer can fire you at any time without explaining any reason, wrongful termination is widespread.\n\nHowever, despite the ‘ at will’ term of the job, the federal employment law still has declared that it’s illegal if an employer is laid-off by an employee for discriminatory, retaliatory reasons or by violating the job contract. There are various other forms of illegal termination and if you have been fired wrongfully as you guess, make sure to contact wrongful termination lawyers in Los Angeles immediately - because if so, you will possibly be entitled to a wrongful termination claim.  \n\n## Is Your Firing Illegal?\n\nAlthough you suspect that your firing is illegal, the law needs solid evidence to prove that it was unlawful. In general, if your performance in job duties is perfectly okay, you have not violated any company rule, committed any in-house theft, or behaved rudely to your senior, and finally wondering of the reason behind it then it would possibly be unlawful. And only the professional wrongful termination lawyers in Los Angeles are the right people to determine if it’s illegal on evaluation of the ins and outs of the story.\n\n## Violation of Job Contract\n\nIf you are having an employment contract or a written contract, with various clauses mentioned in it in terms of your job, security of the job, etc that could be great evidence for your lawyer because first of all having a contract means that you are not ‘at-will’ employee, and secondly, after throughout evaluation of the contract letter, the lawyer can determine whether or not it’s wrongful.\n \n## Whistleblowing and Retaliation\n\nIf you discover that your employer is involved in any illegal activity may be in any form, the workplace environment is poisonous for workers or you are sexually harassed by your supervisor and yet after reporting on this to the employer, no action is taken, and accordingly reported on this to the public department, – then you become a whistleblower. According to federal law, firing anyone for whistleblowing and consequential retaliation is wrongful termination and highly punishable.\n\n## Discrimination\n\nFederal law and all states law have barred employment discrimination with strict laws in place and no matter you are on ‘ at will’ term or got an agreement letter, if the ground of your firing is proven discriminatory, the wrongful termination lawyers in Los Angeles will prove it wrongful. Being fired because of your race, color, gender, national origin, physical disability, or pregnancy, age has been prohibited under the Fair Labor Standards Act under Title VII of the act. For example, being a female employee as you report to your employer regarding your pregnancy, the next day you get a notice of termination.\n\nIn fact, any kind of discrimination whatever maybe it’s from hiring, hiring, training, stop of promotion in the workplace is illegal. Having a seasoned attorney beside is just the right decision as they investigate and gather all required evidences to establish that you are illegally terminated. They make your employer compensate your damages heavily through an out-of-court settlement or a lawsuit.     \n\n## Violation of Public Policy\n\nAgain, the law is against for employers to violate public policies and thus, if you are fired for violating the rule of public policies, then your termination is unlawful. For example –\n\nIf you have been fired for taking a time off to vote, serve on a jury, serve in the military, and blow the whistle to report about your employer\'s illegal reporting or activity that is harmful to society then it’s a violation of public policy.', 'are-you-fired-illegally-get-you-right-back-with-wrongful-termination-lawyers', '2022-05-02 03:21:44', '2022-05-07 22:15:40', 1, 7),

Xi Jinping and Donald Trump have an incentive to point the finger at the other guy at the other country and say, look, they\'re the ones to blame for all of our trouble. Number one, we don\'t know what the numbers are in China. China tells the numbers and but people just don\'t believe the numbers. All along, China has acted with openness, transparency, and responsibility. Perhaps no president since Richard Nixon has had China play such a central role in his domestic political narrative. We could cut off the whole relationship. Now, if USA did, what would happen? It would save 500 billion dollars. The two largest economic powers in the world are trying to control the Coronavirus narrative. The White House has accused China of misleading the world in downplaying the true threat of Covid 19.\r\n\r\nChinese officials have criticized the U.S. for not taking their warnings seriously enough. China has always been open, transparent and responsible and kept reporting information on Covid-19 to WHO, and related countries and regions including the United States. If we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And, certainly the world is paying a big price for what Chinese did. The important thing from the perspective of the Chinese government and therefore the Chinese Communist Party is for Beijing to seize and retain control over the narrative. The primary concerns of the party and Xi Jinping are always, in fact, domestic and a domestic audience.\r\n\r\n![American and Chinese flags and usa dollars](american_and_chinese_flags_and_usa_dollars_438637_3362590dfd.jpg)\r\n\r\nDonald Trump is also focused on winning over his domestic audience and how the Trump administration handles restarting the economy while balancing relations with China could become a key factor in the 2020 election. His departure from the traditional Republican Party was that he would renegotiate these trade deals that the United States had been had been abused and taken advantage of for decades by poor leadership. Leaders in both countries also need someone else to blame and someone to point the finger at. There\'s no question there\'s great power competition between the two countries right now, whether that\'s on a military level, on an economic level or now on this biological and health level, both nations are trying to be number one on the planet. Here\'s what\'s at stake as Trump attempts to take on China over the coronavirus pandemic. Both the Chinese Communist Party and President Trump have accused the other side of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic. And China and the U.S. still remain at odds over where and how the virus originated. It\'s very clear that the origin point of this was in China. But the Chinese government has since started to spread all sorts of alternative theories for other locations that it might have started to. China and the U.S. have disputes over the source of the virus. China has been using social media to fire back at the U.S.\r\n\r\nWhat Trump is most desperate to do right now is to come up with an alternate theory for why he played down the virus so obviously on tape and in interviews throughout January and all February. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus; and this is their new hoax. But this is really the worst attack we\'ve ever had. This is worse than Pearl Harbour. This is worse than the World Trade Centre. There\'s never been an attack like this. The president ultimately is saying, look, it\'s not my fault. We were too slow. It\'s the Chinese government\'s fault. And it should have never happened. Covid 19 could have been stopped at the source in China. The virus originated in China. That\'s not up for debate. And we have questions, unanswered questions the international community does about what happened in those early days. We\'ve seen the United States and China come to blows inside international organizations that we would have expected to function more effectively during this crisis. So we\'ve seen the United States scuttled statements essentially out of theG7 and the U.S. and China disagreeing might lying in the U.N. Security Council as both tried to fashion statements about the coronavirus and the way forward as we see more corona virus deaths. And the numbers don\'t just go up, but they touch more and more people. A friend and a family member, a co-worker, you will see a battle over who to blame, how to target that anger. We have actively responded to the concerns of all the parties and strengthened cooperation with them.\r\n\r\nChina has won time and made positive contributions to the global battle against the epidemic. We know that this is a global pandemic and this is the time for every country to work together to resolve that. To do that, you have to be honest and transparent. Over the last two years, the trade war between China and the U.S. has inflamed tensions between the two governments. The Chinese accused the U.S. of unfair tariffs on Chinese goods, and the U.S. side argued that China was cheating the international system through unfair trade practices and an institutionalized system of intellectual copyright theft. A truce in the trade war appeared in mid-January 2020, when the U.S. and China agreed to eliminate unfair trade practices and also to remove tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. This January, he finally signed the phase one of this China trade deal and more than almost anything else for his domestic political audience. This is a promise made. promise kept. As the Phase one trade agreement was being signed however, the outbreak of Coronavirus in China was raging. How the Trump administration and China react to the pandemic could affect the more than seven hundred and thirty billion in trade at stake between the two nations and the fate of the next stage of U.S. China trade talks. Well, the big question is what happens with the trade relationship? China and the United States have both taken some of the preliminary actions as part of this Phase one deal. What they really look like in practice are some import export changes to rules about meat that can be exported or vegetables that can be imported. They\'re buying a lot off arm products, but are they buying to the level that they were supposed to? They were going to buy 50 billion dollars worth. Coronavirus has changed everything. It\'s changed the economic situations of both countries. And right now, Trump is waiting to see if China will fulfil its obligation. I think that we\'re long overdue for a decoupling of sorts. You want to be careful that just because something is made in China doesn\'t mean that that\'s necessarily a bad thing. Trade is mutually beneficial. The catch is when something is a national strategic resource, such as cyber components or, you know, in this case, necessary medical supplies during a pandemic. You want to be careful about that. President Trump proclaimed the equalization processed with China over a year ago and the rest of the world didn\'t really respond very much to that. But Covid-19 has completely disrupted the global supply chain. It\'s simply a fact that China spawned that virus. That is a fact. China hid that virus for about two months. That is a fact behind the shield of the world trade.\r\n\r\n[World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/), prominent Republicans such as Josh Hawley and Tom Cotton have pushed for the United States to end its dependence on China for cheap retail products, technology and pharmaceuticals. And the Covid-19 outbreak has given even more fuel to this group of lawmakers. USA is going to see that process of decoupling not as signed by Donald Trump, but being pushed forward in a haphazard way in response to the way how the Chinese government has been responding to the crisis, a lot of people have sort of abandoned the idea months ago that there would be a phase two.  Coronavirus really puts the nail in the coffin and the idea that there would be any more phases to the trade deal, phase one is all USA is going to get at this point. I think the positions of people like Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley probably more closely resemble the Republican Party as a whole and even the nation as a whole when you look at both Democrats and Republicans. The polling suggests that the public really is souring on China, whether it\'s trade negotiations, but it\'s more about the coronavirus and the questions that remain and the frustration as the number of casualties, rate rises and people are left with a great anger about what happened. I think that U.S. China relations will sort of be used as a Rorschach test by leaders on both sides of the aisle. That is, if you already saw U.S. China relations as highly competitive and you already believe that the United States needed to decouple from China reducing its supply chain exposure, putting up protectionist measures, you\'re probably likely to see that as all the more true in this environment.\r\n\r\nHopefully they\'re going to keep the deal. We\'ll see. They may not want to find out. The trade negotiations with China were already a key focus leading up to the2020 presidential election. Now, with a pandemic and high unemployment rocking the United States, trade is more important than ever. United States putting taxes on other countries where they\'ve taken advantage, especially China. In the last Democratic presidential debate before Super Tuesday. A surprise policy issue appeared coronavirus. What I would do immediately is to restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He(Donald Trump) tried to cut the funding for NIH. Democratic opponents went after President Trump\'s management of the Covid 19 outbreak, accusing him of failing to act quickly enough to slow the spread of Covid 19 within the US Democratic political action committees latched on to President Trump\'s actions and started their own public campaign to amplify what they saw as a slow and catastrophic response. The Democrats have their own challenge, and it\'s, the way to see it most clearly is to look at the campaign of Joe Biden. The warning signs were mounting in January, he was raising the alarm back then and so were others, including the intelligence the federal intelligence community. And as he\'s become the presumptive nominee. One of his very first ads was slamming Trump on China The U.S. already has more reported deaths from Covid-19 than any other country, and the economic damage continues to take its toll on the average American as the number of unemployed continues to rise. The president has been talking about this idea of extracting some kind of punishment from the Chinese for allowing the coronavirus to spread. How that would look, whether it would be enforceable, what the United States could even get out of that is anybody\'s guess at this point. But the question is whether the president pushes for that right now. We\'re up to, what, close to 10 trillion dollars we\'ve had to appropriate in order to fight this this battle. So what\'s it look? The bill has to come due for China. I think one of the things you\'ve got to look at is the motivation for Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to point the finger at the other guy and the other country. That\'s all about domestic politics, both in China and in the United States. Both leaders have a real political incentive to point the finger and place blame elsewhere, particularly in the United States as we\'re in this election year and dealing with the November election just around the corner now. Some in the U.S. have advocated for legal action against China over the outbreak.\r\n\r\nThere exists no forum and no legal structure under which United States can seek reparations or financial recovery for a pandemic. And the state of Missouri has already filed a civil lawsuit against China in federal court. However, China\'s protected against lawsuits by sovereign immunity in response to this legal protection Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Dan Crenshaw recently introduced legislation that would allow Americans to sue China in federal court. U.S. politicians should stop shirking responsibilities and shifting blame. The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that would require Chinese firms to be audited by U.S. regulators in order to be listed on U.S. stock exchanges. The virus and the pandemic spread are likely to collapse domestic and international policy because it is such a clear moment at which interconnectedness, globalization and U.S. China relations. But also U.S. relations with so many other countries will come to the fore as measures of United States preparedness for reactions to this historic pandemic threat. I think U.S. China relations are much more likely to be front and centre in the upcoming election than they were before. Exactly because of the coronavirus pandemic and its knock on effects for the United States and the world. What remains to be seen is whether Biden can communicate to voters in an effective way, how he would approach China in a different way, and whether then, on the other hand, Trump can defend successfully his very combative.', 'us-china-fight-over-covid-19', '2022-05-02 03:28:06', '2022-05-07 22:15:41', 1, 5),

An efficient national climate change policy and good infrastructure is needed to meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.', 'Recently, Australia’s financial regulators announced that there’s a need to take serious actions against climate change. The Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission cited the risks posed by climate change on the Australian economy.\n\n## How does climate change affect the Australian economy?\n\n- **Financial instability:** Financial authorities have indicated that consistent decline in climate and extreme weather conditions result in loss of property and loss of agriculture that would lead to worsening of the Australian economy. The financial bodies have indicated that the Australian economy is going to suffer on a macro level if climate change is not taken seriously. \n\n- **Damage to Australia’s agriculture:** Due to the surge in CO2 emissions, Australia’s agriculture would be in great danger. For efficient agriculture, climate balance is a must. However, over the years, with the rise in bushfires and other weather extremities, Australia is sliding off from the track of limiting emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\n- **If emissions remain high, the Australian property market would suffer a loss of AUD 571 billion in value by 2030:** According to the central financial bodies, if emission levels continue to rise, Australian property will suffer a major loss. Especially the low-lying areas near the riverbanks and coastlines would go through major transformation. Flood risk would increase in the coming years, thus causing a major threat to property and people residing in those areas. \n\n- **Extreme weather conditions would cause a plunge in food production and other basic needs:** If the emissions continue to rise at the current rate or more, Australia\'s economy, food and labour productivity would suffer a loss of more than AUD 19 billion by 2030. According to the data produced by these financial bodies, Australia has already suffered a loss of Australia’s gross domestic product by around 1%.\n\n- **High carbon border tax:** Every year Australia pays a hefty amount of carbon border tax. Australia exports commodities that are high in carbon consistency; thus, the country goes through a high amount of cross border carbon tax adjustments. Additionally, Australia is exposed to these high taxes due to its ignorance on controlling dependency on carbon and other fossils.\n\n- **880,000 jobs would be lost in the next 50 years if the conditions remain the same:** In a recent report by The European Council for an energy efficient economy, it was showcased that Australian economy would suffer a loss worth trillions and 880,000 jobs in the next 50 years if conditions are not held under control. \n\n### Bottomline\n\nThe losses that the Australian economy is going through due to climate change are inevitable until proper measures to curb carbon and other emissions are not taken care of. The major financial bodies have alerted the government and industry leaders that immediate measures are needed for saving Australia’s economy from falling in an endless loop of suffering due to climate change.\n\nConclusively, an efficient national climate change policy and good infrastructure is needed to meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.', 'how-climate-change-plays-with-the-australian-economy', '2022-05-02 03:44:30', '2022-05-07 22:15:41', 1, 4),

The task is not easy or small! Regarding the train network there are nearly 28,000 Km of railway.', 'In a country as rapidly-developing as Brazil it\'s no surprise that the infrastructure is just as quickly expanding. Communications of all kinds get more and more important and more and more busy too, including the physical means of getting from one place to another, especially the land-based means. Many would argue, as the Brazilians do that all this requires some sort of overall co-ordination and monitoring if it is to be kept in at least minimal balance.\n\nThis is where ANTT, the country\'s National Transportation Agency comes in. The organisation has devised and developed a new kind of \'supersystem\' for scrutinising and directing Brazil\'s railways and road systems. The task is not easy or small! Regarding the train network there are nearly 28,000 Km of rail (not including urban metro systems) of at least four different gauges, ninety-five percent not yet electrified. At this point it\'s important to note a new 10,000 Km set of rail networks, announced by the Brazilian Government in August.\n\nWith roads, if anything the picture is even more complex. Nearly two million kilometers criss-cross the country. About ten percent of it paved and/or tarmac, everything from multi-lane superhighways all the way down to modest, one lane suburban drives. The other ninety per cent is often little more than weather-ridden dirt-tracks. The whole network is huge and is in fact the fourth-largest in the whole world. The purpose of the new surveillance system is ambitious; it is nothing less than to enable the Government to oversee the whole pattern of road and rail transport in Brazil. This will include tracking interstate freight and shipments of all kinds, buses and passenger trains, monitoring traffic flow at \'normal\' or \'exceptional times. The Government believes that the present (in many cases ad hoc) methods already in use do not meet the needs of a rapidly-expanding modern economy like Brazil. After all, the BRICS nation is the world\'s fifth largest in terms of both population and land area and soon hopes to move up to fifth in terms of GDP Economy too.\n\nIn preparation for the full scale implementation of the new transport monitoring scheme, several pilot schemes are already in operation. Perhaps the most notable to date is one on a stretch of railway line between the Port of Santos and Sao Paolo, Brazil\'s ( and indeed the southern hemisphere\'s) largest urban area. This focus has been deliberately chosen for its congestion and also for its potential for problems. After all, the oversee systems are mainly centered at the HQ of ANTT in Brazil and is directly connected to the monitoring mechanisms of MRS and ALL lines.\n\nA vital component is the video camera network, doing a crucial job in assessing whether time constraints and interchanges of rolling stock are going as planned. As regards roads, clearly only the major or middle-ranging highways are eligible for this kind of co-ordinated overseeing. The system is called SNV (Sistema nacional de Viacao) – \'National Highway System\' and is both extensive and fiendishly complicate, to say the least.\n\nNeedless to say, a more efficient land-transport managing system is in the interests of the whole economy, not least including long term investment and short term investment in this booming country and the main reason why individuals and companies are continuing to invest in Brazil and why Investment News publications and websites are around the world continue to list Brazil as the worlds number one investment destination.', 'brazil-invest-in-new-transport-monitoring-system', '2022-05-02 03:52:56', '2022-05-07 22:15:42', 1, 5),
